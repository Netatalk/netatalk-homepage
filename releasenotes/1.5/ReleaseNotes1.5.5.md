## Netatalk 1.5.5

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 1.5.5 of the
Netatalk File Sharing suite. Netatalk is a collection of server programs
and utilities for handling various protocols employed by Apple Macintosh
computers on Unix compatible systems. The suite contains

- afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol,
  allowing clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers

- atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol

- papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access
  printers connected to Unix servers

- timelord - a time server for synchronizing time over the network

- megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix
  computers

- various other utilities

### News in Netatalk 1.5.5

This release of Netatalk features various bug fixes. It is reported to
work well with Photoshop and QuarkXPress.

### Future Enhancements

Netatalk is an actively developed product and its functionality will be
enhanced in future versions. Some of the upcoming features include:

- AFP 3.0 support, including long file names

- A new universal logging system

- Persistent DID support (stable alias support) by default

- Integrated Samba and NFS file locking

- Long file name handling ("mangling") for older AppleShare clients

- 100% QuarkXPress compatibility

- Server-side find capability ("FPCatSearch")

- Improved Documentation

### Supported Platforms

As of Netatalk 1.5.5 the following operating systems are supported:

- FreeBSD

- Linux (Debian, Mandrake, RedHat, SuSE, others should work as well)

- OpenBSD

- Solaris (32bit flavors)

- Tru64

Netatalk may compile and run on other operating systems as well, but it
is not well-tested on those. We welcome patches and suggestions for
enhancing the portability of Netatalk, though.

### Availability

Netatalk tar-balls can be found at:

    <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8642>

Binaries for Debian GNU/Linux will be added to the unstable distribution
soon and will be available at every Debian non-US mirror. Binaries for
other operating systems will be made available at the SourceForge site
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/netatalk/> as time permits.

Netatalk is also available via anonymous CVS. See the SourceForge
project site for anonymous CVS instructions. The main development is
happening in the trunk. Well-tested patches are back-ported to
branch-1-5-prep branch, from which the tar-balls are created.
