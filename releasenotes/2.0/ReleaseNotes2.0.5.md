## Netatalk 2.0.5

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.0.5 of the
Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the latest stable version. It
contains several important bugfixes, including a more complete security
fix for CVE-2008-5718. Time Machine support has been added with the new
volume option "tm". All users are encouraged to upgrade their systems to
2.0.5.

Netatalk is a collection of server programs and utilities for handling
various protocols employed by Apple Macintosh computers on Unix
compatible systems. This allows Unix hosts to act as file, print, and
time servers for Apple Macintosh (classic MacOS as well as MacOS X)
computers.

The suite contains:

- afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol,
  allowing clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers

- atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol

- papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access
  printers connected to Unix servers

- timelord - a time server for synchronizing time over the network

- megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix
  computers

- various supporting programs and utilities
