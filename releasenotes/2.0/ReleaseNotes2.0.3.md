## Netatalk 2.0.3

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.0.3 of the
Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the latest stable version. It
contains several important bugfixes, therefore all users are encouraged
to upgrade their systems to 2.0.3.

Netatalk is a collection of server programs and utilities for handling
various protocols employed by Apple Macintosh computers on Unix
compatible systems. This allows Unix hosts to act as file, print, and
time servers for Apple Macintosh (classic MacOS as well as MacOS X)
computers. Additionally Unix hosts using Netatalk can print to
AppleTalk-only printers.

The suite contains:

- afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol,
  allowing clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers

- atalkd - an implementation of the various AppleTalk protocols

- papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access
  printers connected to Unix servers

- timelord - a time server for synchronizing time over the network

- megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix
  computers

- various other utilities

the GNU General Public License (GPL). Please see

### New in Netatalk 2.0.3

- NEW: afpd: add a cachecnid option that controls if afpd should use the
  IDs stored in the AD2 files as cache. Defaults to off.

- UPD: afpd: deal with more than 32 groups.

- FIX: afpd: several catsearch fixes, based on patch from TSUBAKIMOTO
  Hiroya.

- FIX: afpd: fix a race when a client very quickly reconnects and tries
  to kill its old session.

- FIX: afpd: OSX style symlink caused problems with Panther clients.

- FIX: afpd: old files with default type didn't show the right icon in
  finder, from Shlomi Yaakobovich, slightly modified.

- FIX: cnid_check: disable cnid_check if CNID db was configured with
  transactions and really bail out after the first error.

- FIX: admin-group configure option was broken.

- FIX: several problems with IDs cached in AD2 files.

- FIX: Ignore BIDI in UTF8 hints from OSX.

- FIX: Lots of gcc warning fixes.

- FIX: small configure script changes.

### Future Enhancements

Netatalk is an actively developed product and its functionality will be
enhanced in future versions. Some of the upcoming features include:

- Integrated Samba and NFS file locking

- Better integration of AppleDouble metadata and CNIDs with Samba

### Supported Platforms

As of Netatalk 2.0.3 the following operating systems are supported:

- FreeBSD

- Linux (Debian, Mandrake, RedHat, Suse, others should work as well)

- MacOS X (TCP only)

- OpenBSD

- NetBSD

- Solaris

- Tru64 (TCP only)

Netatalk may compile and run on other operating systems as well, but it
is not well-tested on those. We welcome patches and suggestions for
enhancing the portability of Netatalk as well as success and failure
stories. Please write to netatalk-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
