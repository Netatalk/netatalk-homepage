## Netatalk 2.0.4

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.0.4 of the
Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the latest stable version. It
contains several important bugfixes, including a security fix for papd
(see CVE-2008-5718), therefore all users are encouraged to upgrade their
systems to 2.0.4.

Netatalk is a collection of server programs and utilities for handling
various protocols employed by Apple Macintosh computers on Unix
compatible systems. This allows Unix hosts to act as file, print, and
time servers for Apple Macintosh (classic MacOS as well as MacOS X)
computers. Additionally Unix hosts using Netatalk can print to
AppleTalk-only printers.

The suite contains:

- afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol,
  allowing clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers

- atalkd - an implementation of the various AppleTalk protocols

- papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access
  printers connected to Unix servers

- timelord - a time server for synchronizing time over the network

- megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix
  computers

- various other utilities

### New in Netatalk 2.0.4

- REM: remove timeout

- NEW: afpd: DHX2 uams using GNU libgcrypt.

- NEW: afpd: volume options 'illegalseq', 'perm' and 'invisibledots'
  'ilegalseq' encode illegal sequence in filename asis, ex "\217-",
  which is not a valid SHIFT-JIS char, is encoded as U\217 -. 'perm'
  value OR with the client requested permissions. (help with OSX 10.5
  strange permissions). Make dot files visible by default with
  'usedots', use 'invisibledots' for keeping the old behavior, ie for
  OS9 (OSX hide dot files on its own).

- NEW: afpd: volume options allow_hosts/denied hosts

- NEW: afpd: volume options dperm/fperm default directory and file
  permissions or with server requests.

- NEW: afpd: afpd.conf, allow line continuation with \\

- FIX: afpd: return the right error in createfile and copyfile if the
  disk is full.

- FIX: afpd: resolveid return the same error code than OSX if it's a
  directory

- FIX: afpd: server name check, test for the whole loopback subnet not
  only 127.0.0.1.

- UPD: afpd: limit comments size to 128 bytes, (workaround for Adobe CS2
  bug).

- UPD: afpd: no more daemon icon.

- UPD: usedots, return an invalide name only for .Applexxx files used by
  netatalk not all files starting with .apple.

- UPD: cnid: increase the number of cnid_dbd slots to 512.

- FIX: cnid: dbd detach the daemon from the control terminal.

- UPD: cnid: never ending Berkeley API changes…

- UPD: cnid: dbd add a timeout when reading data from afpd client.

- UPD: cnid: Don't wait five second after the first error when speaking
  to the dbd backend.

- FIX: papd: vars use % not \$

- FIX: papd: quote chars in popen variables expansion. security fix.

- FIX: papd: papd -d didn't write to stderr.

- FIX: papd: ps comments don't always use ()
