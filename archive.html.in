  <h2>Netatalk 2.0.0 is available!</h2>
  <p>The Netatalk development team is proud to present the new stable 2.0.0 release.
    Major improvements over the 1.6 series are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Netatalk's AFP 3.1 compliant file server allows long filenames, UTF-8
      names, large file support and full Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X compatibility</li>
    <li>The print server task can directly interact with CUPS, automagically sharing
      all CUPS queues</li>
    <li>Kerberos V support, allowing true "Single Sign On"</li>
    <li>Whole rework of the CNID subsystem, providing reliable and persistant
      storage of file and directory IDs</li>
    <li>Huge improvements regarding product documentation making Netatalk's features
      accessible more easily</li>
    <li>countless bugs fixed compared to previous versions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In case, you want to upgrade an existing Netatalk 1.x installation, ensure
    you carefully read the upgrade
    guide before and follow the steps outlined there. If you made use of symlinks
    inside Netatalk shares consider setting up a test installation with 2.0 before
    migrating since Netatalk 2.0 provides no support for symlinks any longer.</p>
