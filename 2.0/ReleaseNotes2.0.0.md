## Netatalk 2.0.0

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce the first stable
release of the new netatalk 2.0 codebase!

### Major improvements over the 1.6 series are:

- Netatalk's AFP 3.1 compliant file server allows long filenames, UTF-8
  names, large file support and full Mac OS X compatibility
- The print server task can directly interact with CUPS, automagically
  sharing all CUPS queues
- Kerberos V support, allowing true "Single Sign On"
- Whole rework of the CNID subsystem, providing reliable and persistant
  storage of file and directory IDs
- Huge improvements regarding product documentation, making Netatalk's
  features accessible more easily
- countless bugs fixed compared to previous versions

In case, you want to upgrade an existing Netatalk 1.x installation,
ensure you carefully read the upgrade guide before and follow the steps
outlined there. If you made use of symlinks inside Netatalk shares
consider setting up a test installation with 2.0 before migrating since
Netatalk 2.0 provides no support for symlinks any longer.

Netatalk is a collection of server programs and utilities for handling
various protocols employed by Apple Macintosh computers on Unix
compatible systems. This allows Unix hosts to act as file, print, and
time servers for Apple Macintosh (classic MacOS as well as MacOS X)
computers. Additionally Unix hosts using Netatalk can print to
AppleTalk-only printers.

The suite contains:

- afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol,
  allowing clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers

- atalkd - an implementation of the various AppleTalk protocols

- papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access
  printers connected to Unix servers

- timelord - a time server for synchronizing time over the network

- megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix
  computers

- various other utilities
