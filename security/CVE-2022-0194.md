## Description

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
ad_addcomment function. The issue results from the lack of proper
validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a
fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
