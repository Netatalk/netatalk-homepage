**Summary**  
Lack of validation of user-input data leads to remote code execution in
the copyapplfile function

## Description

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
copyapplfile function. When parsing the len element, the process does
not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying
it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this
vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
