<h1 id="Special-Files-and-Folders">Special Files and Folders</h1><hr/>
<p>Inside netatalk share points you will find several files and directories
which are created automatically by the afpd process either for its own
internal use or for the internal use of the MacOS. None of them should
be directly visible in the Finder on the Mac.</p>
<p>Many of them have to be writeable in order for netatalk to function
properly. This can present problems if users have shell access to the
netatalk server. At the very least, users can &ldquo;hide&rdquo; files inside these
writeable folders. At worst, a malicious user could confuse netatalk in
a bad way. It is unlikely that a malicious user could cause loss of
another user&rsquo;s data by exploiting permissions on these items.</p>
<p>Below is what we hope to be a comprehensive list of these files and
directories, their purpose, and a discussion of what Unix permissions
should be set on them.</p>
<p>Note that in general on Netatalk shares, all directories should have the
setgid bit set. This forces any new files or folders created to have the
same group as the folder they were created in. On some operating
systems, notably FreeBSD, the group owner is always inherited from the
parent directory, so the setgid bit is not necessary.</p>
<h2>.AppleDouble</h2>
<p>This directory exists inside each folder on a Netatalk share. It
contains meta information like creator/type and eventually the resource
fork of each file in that folder. Its permissions should match those of
its parent directory, i.e. anyone who has write access to the parent
directory must have write access to the corresponding .AppleDouble
directory.</p>
<h2>.AppleDouble/.Parent</h2>
<p>This file specifically contains meta information about the directory. If
the directory is the volume root then it contains the volume specific
metadata, especially the &ldquo;volume creation time&rdquo; (important since
AppleShare clients differentiate bitween different volumes on the same
server by this timestamp)</p>
<h2>.AppleDesktop/</h2>
<p>This directory exists under the top level of each share point. It
contains the &ldquo;desktop database&rdquo; which is the method by which the MacOS
associates a type/creator code with a particular application (for an
in-depth discussion have a look at
<a href="http://www.tempel.org/macdev/#DTDB">http://www.tempel.org/macdev/#DTDB</a>). Without it, documents will lose
their application-specific icons and will have a generic icon instead.
Double-clicking documents will also fail.</p>
<p>To allow the desktop database to be maintained correctly, any user who
is likely to copy an application on to the share must have write access
to this directory and all directories below it.</p>
<h2>.AppleDesktop/.volinfo</h2>
<p>This file contains afpd internal volume specific information like
$MAC_CHARSET/$VOL_CHARSET, AppleDouble scheme, CNID backend (including
cnid_metad settings if applicable), dbpath and the like. The information
in this file will be also used by tools like megatron(1) to correctly
convert files to data exchange formats like MacBinary for example.</p>
<h2>Icon\r and .AppleDouble/Icon\r</h2>
<p>These files will exist in any folder, including the top level of a
share, if it has a custom icon and has been created with MacOS versions
prior to MacOS X. Make them writeable to any user who should be allowed
to change that custom icon; make them read-only if you don&rsquo;t want the
custom icon to be changeable.</p>
<h2>:2eVolumeIcon.icns (.VolumeIcon.icns)</h2>
<p>MacOS X stores a custom volume icon into this file (this won&rsquo;t be
displayed on Macs running MacOS versions \&lt; X)</p>
<h2>.AppleDB/</h2>
<p>This folder will exist eventually at the top level of each sharepoint
driven by the cdb or dbd CNID-backends. When using cdb any user who has
write access to any part of the share must have full write access to
this directory and all the files within it otherwise the CNID-backend
will not work properly. Please note that you can force a different
location of this folder via the dbpath option in AppleVolumes.default.</p>
<h2>Network Trash Folder/</h2>
<p>This exists at the top level of each sharepoint. This is where files
that are put in the Trash on clients (prior to MacOS X) go, until the
Trash is emptied.</p>
<p>The permissions of items in this directory are a pretty complicated
subject, but basically you should make this directory and everything in
it world-writeable if you want the Trash can to work properly. If you
don&rsquo;t make it writeable then users will get a message &ldquo;That item cannot
be put in the Trash. Do you want to delete it immediately?&rdquo; if they try
to put something in the Trash.</p>
<p>Unfortunately networked trash handling is broken in current versions of
Mac OS X even if this directory is writeable.</p>
<h2>Temporary Items/</h2>
<p>This folder may exist at the top level of a sharepoint. This folder is
used by certain applications (Adobe Photoshop among others) to store,
well, temporary items. These programs may not work correctly if this
folder is missing or not writeable, when a user tries to work on a
document stored in that Netatalk share.</p>
<h2>TheFindByContentFolder/</h2>
<p>This folder is used by Sherlock 2 to store information use by its Find
by Content feature. Make it writeable by users if you want to allow them
to update the Find by Content index on a netatalk share. Otherwise, make
it read-only.</p>
<h2>TheVolumeSettingsFolder/</h2>
<p>This folder is created at the top level of each share point. It always
appears to be empty. It would be wise to set its permissions the same as
the top level of the sharepoint.</p>
<h2>:2eDS_Store (.DS_Store)</h2>
<p>This appears in share points which have been accessed by a machine
running Mac OS X and contains folder specific metadata as well as file
specific like eg. file comments.</p>
<h2>:2eFBCIndex (.FBCIndex)</h2>
<p>FBC = FindByContent. This File is generated by OS X is roughly
equivalent to OS 9&rsquo;s &ldquo;TheFindByContentFolder&rdquo;. Gets generated only if a
search with activated indexing was performed. Make it writeable by users
if you want to allow them to update the Find by Content index on a
netatalk share. Otherwise, make it read-only.</p>
<h2>:2eFBCLockFolder (.FBCLockFolder)</h2>
<p>contains the :2eFBCSemaphoreFile (.FBCSemaphoreFile) for OS X.</p><hr />
