    predates TCP/IP. It contains different protocols for different uses:
    address resolution, address/name mapping, service location, establishing
    connections, and the like.</p><p>Netatalk implements the AppleTalk protocols to serve files over AFP
    and provide other services to old Mac and Apple II clients.</p><p>A complete overview can be found inside the <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/blob/main/doc/README.AppleTalk" target="_top">developer
    documentation</a>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-1.7.2.5"></a>To use AppleTalk or not</h3></div></div></div><p>You'll need the AppleTalk support built into Netatalk to provide
      file services to older AFP clients not capable of using AFP over TCP. It
      also enables printing services via PAP by <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">papd</span>(8)</span>, a timeserver <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">timelord</span>(8)</span> for older Mac clients, and NetBoot server
      <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">a2boot</span>(8)</span> for Apple II clients.</p><p>In addition, if you are serving Classic Mac OS clients, you might
      consider using AppleTalk for service propagation/location, having the
      ease of use for your network clients in mind. The Apple engineers
      implemented a way to easily locate an AFP server via AppleTalk but
      establishing the AFP connection itself via AFP over TCP (see the
      developer documentation for details on this cool feature, too).</p><p>To use the different base AppleTalk protocols with Netatalk, one
      has to use <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">atalkd</span>(8)</span>. It can also be used as an AppleTalk router to connect
      different independent network segments to each other.</p><p>To use AppleTalk/atalkd, your system has to have kernel support
      for AppleTalk. If missing, you will be restricted to AFP over TCP, and
      won't be able to use either of the AppleTalk services described in this
      chapter.</p><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.5.6"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.1. Enable AppleTalk in afp.conf</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">appletalk = yes</pre><p>If Netatalk has

      In case, you have only one network interface up and running, you haven't
      to deal with atalkd's config at all: atalkd will use AppleTalk's
      self-configuration features to get an AppleTalk address and to register
      itself in the network automagically.</p><p>In case, you have more than one active network interface, you have
      to make a decision:</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-1.7.2.6.4"></a>Using only one interface</h4></div></div></div><p>Just add the interface name (en1, le0, eth2, ... for example) to

          atalkd filled in the AppleTalk settings that apply to this network
          segment. A netrange of 0-65534 indicates that there is no AppleTalk
          router present, so atalkd will fetch an address that matches the
          following criteria: netrange from inside the so called "startup
          range" 65280-65533 and a node address between 142 and 255.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id-1.7.2.6.5"></a>Using several interfaces</h4></div></div></div><p>When using several interfaces you have to add them line by line

          networking should be enabled on all three interfaces, but no routing
          should be done between the different segments. Again, all the

          networks.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.6.5.4"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.5. atalkd.conf containing several entries with the -dontroute

eth2 -dontroute -phase 2 -net 1-1000 -addr 10.142 -zone "Printers"</pre><p>
          On eth0 and eth1, there are no other routers present, so atalkd
          chooses an address from within the startup range. But on eth2 there
          lives an already connected AppleTalk router, publishing one zone
          called "Printers" and forcing clients to assign themselves an
          address in a netrange between 1 and 1000.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>In this case, atalkd will handle each interface as it would be
        the only active one. This can have some side effects when it comes to
        the point where AFP clients want to do the magic switch from AppleTalk
        to TCP, so use this with caution.</p><p>In case, you have more than one active network interface and do
        not take special precautions as outlined above, then autoconfiguration
        of the interfaces might fail in a situation where one of your network
        interfaces is connected to a network where <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>
        other active AppleTalk router is present and supplies appropriate
        routing settings.</p><p>For further information see <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">atalkd.conf</span>(5)</span> and the developer documentation.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id-1.7.2.7"></a>atalkd acting as an AppleTalk router<a id="id-1.7.2.7.1.1" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>Several types of AppleTalk routers exist: seed, non-seed and so
      called soft-seed routers.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>A seed router has its own configuration and publishes this
          into the network segments it is configured for.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A non-seed router needs a seed router on the interface to
          which it is connected to learn the network configuration. So this
          type of AppleTalk router can work completely without manual
          configuration.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A so called soft-seed router is exactly the same as a non-seed
          router except the fact, that it can also remember the configuration
          of a seed router and act as a replacement in case, the real seed
          router disappears from the net.</p></li></ul></div><p>Netatalk's atalkd can act as both a seed and a soft-seed router,
      even in a mixed mode, where it acts on one interface in this way and on
      the other in another.</p><p>If you leave your atalkd.conf completely empty or simply add all
      active interfaces line by line without using seed settings (atalkd will
      act identically in both cases), then atalkd is forced to act as a
      soft-seed router on each interface, so it will fail on the first
      interface, where no seed router is accessible to fetch routing
      information from.</p><p>In this case, other services, that depend on atalkd, might also
      fail.</p><p>So you should have atalkd act as a seed router on one or all
      active interfaces. A seed router has to supply informations
      about:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The specific netrange on this segment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Its own AppleTalk address</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The zones (one to many) available in this segment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The so called "default zone" for this segment</p></li></ul></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>Unless you are the network admin yourself, consider asking them
        before changing anything related to AppleTalk routing, as changing
        these settings might have side effects for all of your AppleTalk
        network clients!</p></div><p>In an AppleTalk network netranges have to be unique and must not
      overlap each other. Fortunately netatalk's atalkd is polite enough to
      check whether your settings are in conflict with already existing ones
      on the net. In such a case it simply discards your settings and tries to
      adapt the already established ones on the net (if in doubt, always check
      syslog for details).</p><p>Netranges, you can use, include pretty small ones, eg. 42-42, to
      very large ones, eg. 1-65279 - the latter one representing the maximum.
      In routed environments you can use any numbers in the range between 1
      and 65279 unless they do not overlap with settings of other connected
      subnets.</p><p>The own AppleTalk address consists of a net part and a node part
      (the former 16 bit, the latter 8 bit, for example 12057.143). Apple
      recommends using node addresses of 128 or above for servers, letting
      client Macs assign themselves an address faster (as they will primarily
      search for a node address within 1-127 in the supplied netrange). As we
      don't want to get in conflict with Apple servers, we prefer using node
      addresses of 142 or above.</p><p>AppleTalk zones have <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> to do with
      physical networks. They're just a hint for your client's convenience,
      letting them locate network resources in a more comfortable/faster way.
      You can either use one zone name across multiple physical segments as
      well as more than one zone name on a single segment (and various
      combinations of this).</p><p>So all you have to do is to <span class="emphasis"><em>draw a network
      chart</em></span> containing the physical segments, the netranges you
      want to assign to each one, the zone names you want to publish in which
      segments and the default zone per segment (this is always the first zone
      name, you supply with the <span class="emphasis"><em>-zone</em></span> switch in
      atalkd.conf).</p><p>If you finished the steps outlined above, you might want to
      edit atalkd.conf to fit your needs.</p><p>You'll have to set the following options in atalkd.conf:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>-net (use reasonable values between 1-65279 for each
          interface)</p><p>In case, this value is suppressed but -addr is present, the
          netrange from this specific address will be used</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>-addr (the net part must match the -net settings if present,
          the node address should be between 142 and 255)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>-zone (can be used multiple times in one single line, the
          first entry is the default zone)</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that you are able to set up "zone mapping", that means
      publishing exactly the same zone name on all AppleTalk segments, as well
      as providing more than one single zone name per interface. Dumb
      AppleTalk devices, like LaserWriters, will always register themselves in
      the default zone (the first zone entry you use in atalkd.conf per
      interface), more intelligent ones will have the ability to choose one
      specific zone via a user interface.</p><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.7.19"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.6. atalkd.conf making netatalk a seed router on two
        interfaces</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">eth0 -seed -phase 2 -net 1-1000 -addr 1000.142 -zone "Printers" -zone "Spoolers"
eth1 -seed -phase 2 -net 1001-2000 -addr 2000.142 -zone "Macs" -zone "Servers"</pre><p>
        The settings for eth0 force AppleTalk devices within the connected
        network to assign themselves an address in the netrange 1-1000. Two
        zone names are published into this segment, "Printers" being the so
        called "standard zone", forcing dumb AppleTalk devices like Laser
        printers to show up automatically into this zone. AppleTalk printer
        queues supplied by netatalk's papd can be registered into the zone
        "Spoolers" simply by adjusting the settings in <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">papd.conf</span>(5)</span>. On eth1 we use the different and non-overlapping
        netrange 1001-2000, set the default zone to "Macs" and publish a

        same zone name on both segments. As the same zone name will be used on
        all segments of the AppleTalk network no zone names will show up at
        all... but AppleTalk routing will still be active. In this case, we
        connect a so called "non-extended" LocalTalk network (phase 1) to an
        EtherTalk "extended" network (phase 2) transparently.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.7.21"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.8. atalkd.conf for a soft-seed router configuration</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">eth0 eth1 eth2</pre><p> As we have more
        than one interface, atalkd will try to act as an AppleTalk router
        between both segments. As we don't supply any network configuration on
        our own we depend on the availability of seed routers in every
        connected segment. If only one segment is without such an available
        seed router the whole thing will fail.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.7.22"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.9. atalkd.conf for a soft-seed router configuration after atalkd

        In this case, active seed routers are present in all three connected
        networks, so atalkd was able to fetch the network configuration from
        them and, since the settings do not conflict, act as a soft-seed
        router from now on between the segments. So even in case, all of the
        three seed routers would disappear from the net, atalkd would still
        supply the connected network with the network configuration once
        learned from them. Only in case, atalkd would be restarted afterwards,
        the routing information will be lost (as we're not acting as seed
        router).</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.2.7.23"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.10. atalkd.conf ready for mixed seed/soft-seed mode</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">eth0

        In case in the network connected to eth0 lives no active seed router
        or one with a mismatching configuration (eg. an overlapping netrange
        of 1-200) atalkd will fail. Otherwise it will fetch the configuration
        from this machine and will route between eth0 and eth1, on the latter
        acting as a seed router itself.</p></div></div><br class="example-break" /><p>By the way: It is perfectly legal to have more than one seed
      router connected to a network segment. But in this case, you should take
      care that the configuration of all connected routers is exactly the same

      lpd<a id="id-1.7.3.5.2.2" class="indexterm"></a>, BSD lpr<a id="id-1.7.3.5.2.3" class="indexterm"></a>, LPRng<a id="id-1.7.3.5.2.4" class="indexterm"></a>, CUPS<a id="id-1.7.3.5.2.5" class="indexterm"></a> or the like.</p><p>Since it is so important to answer the client's feature queries
      correctly, how does papd achieve this? By parsing the relevant keywords
      of the assigned PPD<a id="id-1.7.3.5.3.1" class="indexterm"></a> file. When using CUPS, papd will attempt to generate a
      PPD file on the fly by querying the printer via IPP. With other
      spoolers, choosing the correct PPD is important to be able to
      print.</p><p>Netatalk formerly had built-in support for System V lpd printing
      in a way that papd saved the printed job directly into the spooldir and
      calls <span class="command"><strong>lpd</strong></span> afterwards, to pick up the file and do the
      rest. Due to incompatibilities with many lpd implementations the normal
      behaviour was to print directly into a pipe instead of specifying a
      printer by name and using lpd interaction. As of Netatalk 2.0, another
      alternative has been implemented: direct interaction with CUPS (Note:
      when CUPS support is compiled in, then the SysV lpd support doesn't work
      at all). Detailed examples can be found in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">papd.conf</span>(5)</span> manual page.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="paplpdsupport"></a>Integrating <span class="command"><strong>papd</strong></span> with SysV lpd</h4></div></div></div><p>Unless CUPS support has been compiled in (which is default from
        Netatalk 2.0 on) one simply defines the lpd queue in question by
        setting the <code class="option">pr</code> parameter to the queue name. If no
        <code class="option">pr</code> parameter is set, the default printer will be
        used.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="pappipesupport"></a>Using pipes with <span class="command"><strong>papd</strong></span></h4></div></div></div><p>An alternative to the technique outlined above is to direct
        papd's output via a pipe into another program. Using this mechanism
        almost all printing systems can be driven.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="papcupssupport"></a>Using direct CUPS support</h4></div></div></div><p>Starting with Netatalk 2.0, direct CUPS integration is
        available. In this case, defining only a queue name as
        <code class="option">pr</code> parameter won't invoke the SysV lpd daemon but
        uses CUPS instead. Unless a specific PPD has been assigned using the
        <code class="option">pd</code> switch, the PPD configured in CUPS will be used by
        <span class="command"><strong>papd</strong></span>, too.</p><p>There exists one special share named
        <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsautoadd</em></span>. If this is present in papd.conf,
        then all available CUPS queues will be served automagically using the
        parameters assigned to this global share. But subsequent printer
        definitions can be used to override these global settings for
        individual spoolers.</p><div class="example"><a id="id-1.7.3.5.7.4"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 4.11. Example syntax, assigning root as operator:</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">cupsautoadd:op=root:</pre></div></div><br class="example-break" /></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="papclient"></a>Using AppleTalk printers</h3></div></div></div><p>Netatalk's <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="command"><strong>papstatus</strong></span></span>(8)</span> can be used to query AppleTalk printers, <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="command"><strong>pap</strong></span></span>(1)</span> to print to them.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>pap</strong></span> can be used stand-alone or as part of an
