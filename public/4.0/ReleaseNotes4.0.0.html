<h1>Netatalk 4.0.0</h1><hr />
<h1>Netatalk 4.0.0 is available!</h1>
<p>The Netatalk team is proud to announce the first release in the <strong>Netatalk 4.0</strong> release series.</p>
<p>This release constitutes major changes over Netatalk 3.2, and is recommended for early adopters. We strongly suggest that you take a backup of your production environment before attempting to upgrade an existing Netatalk deployment to 4.0.0.</p>
<p>The standout change in this release version is the reintroduction of traditional Macintosh and Apple II networking, namely the AppleTalk transport layer and corresponding tool suite.</p>
<p>This partially reverses the drastic changes in Netatalk 3.0.0 released in early 2012. While the decision made sense in the context of that era, a big part of the appeal of the AFP protocol today lies in the ability to communicate seamlessly between the very latest and very oldest networked Apple machines. Hence, we are excited to bring back the pre-TCP/IP era of Apple networking in today&rsquo;s release!</p>
<p>In short, we are combining the modern niceties of Netatalk 3 with the backwards compatibility of Netatalk 2, to produce the ultimate Apple networking suite.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/blob/netatalk-4-0-0/NEWS">NEWS</a> for the full changelog, and find reference documentation in the <a href="https://netatalk.io/4.0/htmldocs/">manual</a>. We are providing a thorough <a href="https://netatalk.io/4.0/htmldocs/upgrade">upgrade guide</a> for you who are doing an in-place upgrade of a 3.x or 2.x deployment.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<h3>AppleTalk</h3>
<p>The Netatalk AFP file server can once again serve files over AppleTalk, to Macs running System Software 7.x, 6.0.x, as well as networked Apple IIGS and Apple //e machines. In addition, Classic Mac OS 8/9 get the benefit of automatic service discovery that relies on AppleTalk.</p>
<p>We also bring back PAP printing (print from old Macs to modern printers, or a modern machine to LocalTalk printers), an AppleTalk time server, and an Apple II netboot server.</p>
<p>To enable AppleTalk support, Netatalk needs to be built with the <code>-Dwith-appletalk=true</code> flag, and you need to set <code>appletalk = yes</code> in your afp.conf file.</p>
<h4>New daemons</h4>
<ul>
<li>atalkd – AppleTalk network management</li>
<li>papd – Print server</li>
<li>timelord – Time server</li>
<li>a2boot – Apple II netboot server</li>
</ul>
<h4>New config files</h4>
<ul>
<li>atalkd.conf</li>
<li>papd.conf</li>
</ul>
<h4>New utilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>aecho – ping AppleTalk servers</li>
<li>getzones – inquire about AppleTalk zones</li>
<li>nbplkup – inquire about AppleTalk services</li>
<li>nbprgstr – register AppleTalk service</li>
<li>nbpunrgstr – release AppleTalk service registration</li>
<li>pap – print to LocalTalk printer</li>
<li>papstatus – inquire the status of a LocalTalk printer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bundled MacIP</h3>
<p>We now bundle the venerable <code>macipgw</code> daemon with Netatalk, which enables Macs that for some reason don&rsquo;t have access to a TCP/IP network to browse the web or do file sharing over AFP.</p>
<p><code>macipgw</code> was originally written by Stefan Bethke in the late 90s, and has now been bundled with Netatalk with his blessing.</p>
<p>Note that <code>macipgw</code> is not a plug&rsquo;n&rsquo;play app. The user needs to configure a network tunnel and IPv4 address forwarding (and most likely NAT, too) for it to work.</p>
<h3>Webmin Module</h3>
<p><a href="https://webmin.com/">Webmin</a> is a platform for system administration via a user friendly web app. A first-party Webmin module for Netatalk has existed for 25 years, but for the first time it is now bundled with Netatalk proper. You can build it by passing <code>-Dwith-webmin=true</code> to the build system, or download and install the module tarball distributed with this release.</p>
<h3>Added build time options</h3>
<p>Pass the following options to <code>meson setup build</code> when building Netatalk from source.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Dwith-appletalk=true|false</code> – Enable or disable the AppleTalk transport layer.</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-webmin=true|false</code> - Enable or disable packaging and installing the Webmin module.</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-manual=none|local|www</code> - The type of html manual to build. (In 3.2 it was a boolean option.)</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-manual-l10n</code> - List of manual translations to build. Currently supporting only <code>ja</code> (Japanese).</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-readmes=true|false</code> - Install README docs, converted from markdown to plain text</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-init-style</code> - Now takes a comma separated list of init styles to build. (In 3.2 it was a single style.)</li>
<li><code>-Dwith-unicode-data-path</code> - Specify the path to the dir containing UnicodeData.txt (see below.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Added runtime options</h3>
<p>The following options can be enabled in <code>afp.conf</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>appletalk</code> – Enable AFP-over-DDP (AppleTalk) transport layer.</li>
<li><code>ddp address</code> – The DDP address to bind the AFP file server to.</li>
<li><code>ddp zone</code> – The AppleTalk zone that the AFP file server will register with.</li>
<li><code>legacy volume size</code> – Limit the reported volume size to 2GB for very old clients.</li>
<li><code>prodos</code> – Enable Apple II compatibility mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dependency Changes</h2>
<h3>Libgcrypt</h3>
<p>Netatalk now requires only Libgcrypt for all user authentication. Dependencies on OpenSSL, LibreSSL, and wolfSSL have been completely removed.</p>
<h3>GLib and D-Bus</h3>
<p>The dependency on the obsoleted <code>dbus-glib</code> library for the <code>afpstats</code> tool has been removed, and we now use the native GDBus API of GLib itself.</p>
<h3>UnicodeData.txt</h3>
<p>While Netatalk previously had pre-generated Unicode lookup tables based on fixed Unicode revisions, we now generate this code on the fly using the UnicodeData.txt database file. Many distributions ship a Unicode package that contains this file, but if your distro lacks one you can <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">download it from unicode.org</a> and point <code>-Dwith-unicode-data-path</code> to the location where you put it.</p>
<h3>DocBook XSL and xstlproc</h3>
<p>Netatalk no longer ships canned troff manual pages, but will generate them on the fly from XML sources using xsltproc and DocBook XSL stylesheets. If either of these dependencies is missing, you can disable the documentation with <code>-Dwith-manual=none</code>.</p>
<h2>Deprecated Features</h2>
<h3>PGP User Authentication Method</h3>
<p>The PGP UAM relies on an unofficial Mac OS client that was released as an experiment in the late 90s, and hasn&rsquo;t been proven working with modern PGP keys. Removed as part of the Libgcrypt migration.</p>
<h3>Autotools</h3>
<p>The traditional Autotools (libtool / autoconf / automake) build system has been removed, in favor of the Meson build system.</p>
