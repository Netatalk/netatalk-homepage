    AFP<a id="idm217" class="indexterm"></a> services and both can run at the same time. Classic AFP
    over AppleTalk requires the <span class="command"><strong>afpd</strong></span> and
    <span class="command"><strong>atalkd</strong></span> daemons. AFP over IP only requires
    <span class="command"><strong>afpd</strong></span>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm223"></a>Setting up the AFP file server</h3></div></div></div><p>AFP (the Apple Filing Protocol) is the protocol Apple Macintoshes
      use for file services up until OS X Mountain Lion (10.8). The protocol
      has evolved over the years. The
      latest change to the protocol, AFP 3.4, was introduced with
      the release of OS X Mountain Lion<a id="idm226" class="indexterm"></a>. Netatalk 2.2 supports up to AFP 3.3.</p><p>AFP3 brought some big changes. For the first time, AFP3 supports
      pathnames up to 65535 characters. It is virtually unlimited. Netatalk
      2.2 supports filenames up to 255 characters because Mac OS X 10.4 and
      earlier can use it up to 255 characters (actually 255 bytes leading to
      85-255 chars depending on the glyphs used), Decomposed UTF-8 (UTF8-MAC)
      is used on the wire and large files (&gt;4GB) are supported.</p><p>The afpd daemon offers the fileservices to Apple Clients. It's
      configured using the <code class="filename">afpd.conf</code> and the
      <code class="filename">AppleVolumes.*</code> files.</p><p>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) added support for Time Machine backups
      over AFP. Two new functions ensure that backups are written to spinning
      disk, not just in the server's cache. Different host operating systems
      honour this cache flushing differently. To make a volume a Time Machine
      target use the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">AppleVolumes.default</span>(5)</span> volume option <code class="option">tm</code>.</p><p>Starting with Netatalk 2.1 UNIX symlinks<a id="idm239" class="indexterm"></a> can be used on the server. Semantics are the same as for
      eg NFS, i.e. they are not resolved on the server side but instead it's
      completely up to the client to resolve them, resulting in links that
      point somewhere inside the clients filesystem view.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm242"></a>afpd.conf</h4></div></div></div><p>afpd.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to determine
        the behaviour and configuration of the different virtual file servers
        that it provides. Any line not prefixed with <span class="keycode">'#</span>' is
        interpreted.</p><p>If afpd switches set on the command line are in conflict with
        afpd.conf settings, the latter will have higher priority.</p><p>Format: - [options] to specify options for the default server
        and/or "Server name" [options] to specify an additional server.</p><p>Leaving the afpd.conf file empty equals to the following
        configuration:</p><pre class="programlisting">- -transall -uamlist uams_dhx.so,uams_dhx2.so</pre><p>For a more detailed explanation of the available options, please

        will by default be shown to all users, including users logged in as
        guest. A volume will not be presented in the chooser, if the user has
        no read access to the specified volume path.</p><p>You can limit access to a specific volume by using the
        <code class="option">allow</code> and <code class="option">deny</code> options.</p><p>For a more detailed explanation of the available options, please
        refer to the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">AppleVolumes.default</span>(5)</span> man page.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="CNID-backends"></a>CNID<a id="idm267" class="indexterm"></a> backends<a id="idm270" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike other protocols like SMB or NFS, the AFP protocol mostly
      refers to files and directories by ID and not by a path (the IDs are
      also called CNID, that means Catalog Node ID). A typical AFP request
      uses a directory ID<a id="idm274" class="indexterm"></a> and a filename, something like <span class="phrase">"server, please
      open the file named 'Test' in the directory with id 167"</span>. For
      example "Aliases" on the Mac basically work by ID (with a fallback to
      the absolute path in more recent AFP clients. But this applies only to
      Finder, not to applications).</p><p>Every file in an AFP volume has to have a unique file ID<a id="idm279" class="indexterm"></a>, IDs must, according to the specs, never be reused, and
      IDs are 32 bit numbers (Directory IDs use the same ID pool). So, after
      ~4 billion files/folders have been written to an AFP volume, the ID pool
      is depleted and no new file can be written to the volume. No whining
      please :-)</p><p>Netatalk needs to map IDs to files and folders in the host
      filesystem. To achieve this, several different CNID backends<a id="idm283" class="indexterm"></a> are available and can be selected with the
      <code class="option">cnidscheme</code><a id="idm286" class="indexterm"></a> option in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">AppleVolumes.default</span>(5)</span> configuration file. A CNID backend is basically a
      database storing ID &lt;-&gt; name mappings.</p><p>The CNID Databases are by default located in the
      .AppleDB<a id="idm293" class="indexterm"></a> folder in every afpd volume root. With the new
      ADv2<a id="idm296" class="indexterm"></a> format, afpd stores the files/directories ID in the
      corresponding .AppleDouble file as well.</p><p>Starting with Netatalk 2.1 there is a command line utility called
      <span class="command"><strong>dbd</strong></span> available which can be used to verify, repair and
      rebuild the CNID database.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>There are some CNID related things you should keep in mind when
        working with netatalk:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Don't nest volumes<a id="idm306" class="indexterm"></a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>CNID backends are databases, so they turn afpd into a file
            server/database mix. Keep this in mind, killing an afpd process
            with <span class="command"><strong>kill -9</strong></span> will likely leave the database
            unusable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If there's no more space on the filesystem left, the
            database will get corrupted. You can work around this by either
            using the -dbpath option and put the database files into another
            location or, if you use quotas, make sure the .AppleDB folder is
            owned by a user/group without a quota<a id="idm313" class="indexterm"></a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Be careful with CNID databases for volumes that are mounted
            via NFS. That is a pretty audacious decision to make anyway, but
            putting a database there as well is really asking for trouble,
            i.e. database corruption. Use the dbpath: directive in the
            <code class="filename">AppleVolumes.*</code> configuration files to put the
            databases onto a local disk if you must use NFS<a id="idm319" class="indexterm"></a> mounted volumes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm322"></a>cdb<a id="idm324" class="indexterm"></a></h4></div></div></div><p>The "concurrent database" backend is based on
        Berkeley DB. With this backend, several afpd daemons access the CNID
        database directly. Berkeley DB locking is used to synchronize access,
        if more than one afpd process is active for a volume. The drawback is,
        that the crash of a single afpd process might corrupt the database.
        cdb should only be used when sharing home directories for a larger
        number of users <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> it has been determined that a
        large number of <span class="command"><strong>cnid_dbd</strong></span> processes is
        problematic.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm330"></a>dbd<a id="idm332" class="indexterm"></a></h4></div></div></div><p>Access to the CNID database is restricted to the cnid_dbd daemon
        process. afpd processes communicate with the daemon for database reads
        and updates. The probability for database corruption is practically
        zero. As a database process gets spawned for each volume, you're
        probably better off using cdb for sharing home directories for a
        larger number of users.</p><p>This is the default backend since Netatalk 2.1.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm337"></a>tdb<a id="idm339" class="indexterm"></a></h4></div></div></div><p><abbr class="abbrev">tdb</abbr> is another persistent CNID database, it's

            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> shared and accessed by multiple clients
            at once !</p></div><p>This backend is also used internally (as in-memory CNID
        database) as a fallback in case opening the primary database can't be
        opened, because <abbr class="abbrev">tdb</abbr> can work as in-memory database.
        This of course means upon restart the CNIDs are gone.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm350"></a>last<a id="idm352" class="indexterm"></a></h4></div></div></div><p>The last backend is a semi-persistent backend. IDs will be
        reused and, what is much worse, you can get duplicate IDs. You should
        use it for sharing cdroms only, <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> use it for
        sharing normal volumes.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="charsets"></a>Charsets<a id="idm359" class="indexterm"></a>/Unicode<a id="idm362" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p></p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm365"></a>Why Unicode?</h4></div></div></div><p>Internally, computers don't know anything about characters and
        texts, they only know numbers. Therefore, each letter is assigned a
        number. A character set, often referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>charset</em></span> or
        <span class="emphasis"><em>codepage</em></span><a id="idm370" class="indexterm"></a>, defines the mappings between numbers and
        letters.</p><p>If two or more computer systems need to communicate with each
        other, the have to use the same character set. In the 1960s the
        ASCII<a id="idm373" class="indexterm"></a> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
        character set was defined by the American Standards Association. The
        original form of ASCII represented 128 characters, more than enough to
        cover the English alphabet and numerals. Up to date, ASCII has been
        the normative character scheme used by computers.</p><p>Later versions defined 256 characters to produce a more
        international fluency and to include some slightly esoteric graphical
        characters. Using this mode of encoding each character takes exactly
        one byte. Obviously, 256 characters still wasn't enough to map all the
        characters used in the various languages into one character
        set.</p><p>As a result localized character sets were defined later, e.g the
        ISO-8859 character sets. Most operating system vendors introduced
        their own characters sets to satisfy their needs, e.g. IBM defined the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>codepage 437 (DOSLatinUS)</em></span>, Apple introduced the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>MacRoman</em></span><a id="idm380" class="indexterm"></a> codepage and so on. The characters that were assigned
        number larger than 127 were referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>extended</em></span> characters. These character sets
        conflict with another, as they use the same number for different
        characters, or vice versa.</p><p>Almost all of those characters sets defined 256 characters,
        where the first 128 (0-127) character mappings are identical to ASCII.
        As a result, communication between systems using different codepages
        was effectively limited to the ASCII charset.</p><p>To solve this problem new, larger character sets were defined.
        To make room for more character mappings, these character sets use at
        least 2 bytes to store a character. They are therefore referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>multibyte</em></span> character sets.</p><p>One standardized multibyte charset encoding scheme is known as
        <a class="ulink" href="https://www.unicode.org/" target="_top">Unicode</a>. A big advantage
        of using a multibyte charset is that you only need one. There is no
        need to make sure two computers use the same charset when they are
        communicating.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm389"></a>character sets used by Apple</h4></div></div></div><p>In the past, Apple clients used single-byte charsets to
        communicate over the network. Over the years Apple defined a number of
        codepages, western users will most likely be using the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>MacRoman</em></span> codepage.</p><p>Codepages defined by Apple include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>MacArabic, MacFarsi</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCentralEurope</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacChineseSimple</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacChineseTraditional</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCroatian</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCyrillic</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacDevanagari</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacGreek</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacHebrew</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacIcelandic</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacJapanese</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacKorean</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacRoman</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacRomanian</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacThai</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacTurkish</p></li></ul></div><p>Starting with Mac OS X and AFP3, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.utf-8.com/" target="_top">UTF-8</a> is used. UTF-8 encodes
        Unicode characters in an ASCII compatible way, each Unicode character
        is encoded into 1-6 ASCII characters. UTF-8 is therefore not really a
        charset itself, it's an encoding of the Unicode charset.</p><p>To complicate things, Unicode defines several <span class="emphasis"><em> <a class="ulink" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/index.html" target="_top">normalization</a>
        </em></span> forms. While <a class="ulink" href="https://www.samba.org" target="_top">Samba</a><a id="idm433" class="indexterm"></a> uses <span class="emphasis"><em>precomposed</em></span><a id="idm436" class="indexterm"></a> Unicode, which most Unix tools prefer as well, Apple
        decided to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>decomposed</em></span><a id="idm440" class="indexterm"></a> normalization.</p><p>For example lets take the German character
        '<span class="keycode">ä</span>'. Using the precomposed normalization, Unicode
        maps this character to 0xE4. In decomposed normalization, 'ä' is
        actually mapped to two characters, 0x61 and 0x308. 0x61 is the mapping
        for an 'a', 0x308 is the mapping for a <span class="emphasis"><em>COMBINING
        DIAERESIS</em></span>.</p><p>Netatalk refers to precomposed UTF-8 as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>UTF8</em></span><a id="idm448" class="indexterm"></a> and to decomposed UTF-8 as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>UTF8-MAC</em></span><a id="idm452" class="indexterm"></a>.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idm455"></a>afpd and character sets</h4></div></div></div><p>To support new AFP 3.x and older AFP 2.x clients at the same
        time, afpd needs to be able to convert between the various charsets
        used. AFP 3.x clients always use UTF8-MAC, AFP 2.x clients use one of
        the Apple codepages.</p><p>At the time of this writing, netatalk supports the following
        Apple codepages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_CENTRALEUROPE</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_CHINESE_SIMP</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_CHINESE_TRAD</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_CYRILLIC</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_GREEK</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_HEBREW</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_JAPANESE</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_KOREAN</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_ROMAN</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MAC_TURKISH</p></li></ul></div><p>afpd handles three different character set options:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">unixcodepage<a id="idm484" class="indexterm"></a></span></dt><dd><p>This is the codepage used internally by your operating

              afpd tries to detect the codepage, otherwise it defaults to
              ASCII<a id="idm489" class="indexterm"></a>. afpd uses this codepage to read its
              configuration files, so you can use extended characters for

              characters, or characters illegal in unix filenames, when saving
              files on a unix filesystem. Earlier versions used the the so
              called CAP encoding<a id="idm520" class="indexterm"></a>. An extended character (&gt;0x7F) would be

        authentication and UAMs in general. But since Apple introduced an
        option called "Allow Secure Connections Using SSH" and many people
        tend to confuse both things, we'll speak about that here too.</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="manualsshtunnel"></a>Manually tunneling an AFP session</h5></div></div></div><p>This works since the first AFP servers that spoke "AFP over
          TCP" appeared in networks. One simply tunnels the remote server's
          AFP port to a local port different than 548 and connects locally to
          this port afterwards. On MacOS X this can be done by</p><pre class="programlisting">ssh -l $USER $SERVER -L 10548:127.0.0.1:548 sleep 3000</pre><p>After establishing the tunnel one will use
          <code class="filename">"afp://127.0.0.1:10548"</code> in the "Connect to
          server" dialog. All AFP traffic including the initial connection
          attempts will be sent encrypted over the wire since the local AFP
          client will connect to the Mac's local port 10548 which will be
          forwarded to the remote server's AFP port (we used the default 548)
          over SSH.</p><p>This sort of tunnel is an ideal solution if you must access
          an AFP server through the Internet without having the ability
          or desire to use a "real" VPN.
          Note that you can let <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> compress the data by
          using its "-C" switch and that the tunnel endpoints can be different
          from both AFP client and server (compare with the SSH documentation
          for details).</p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="autosshtunnel"></a>Automatically establishing a tunneled AFP connection</h5></div></div></div><p>From Mac OS X 10.2 to 10.4, Apple added an "Allow Secure
          Connections Using SSH" checkbox to the "Connect to Server" dialog.
          The idea behind: When the server signals that it can be contacted by
          SSH then Mac OS X' AFP client tries to establish the tunnel and
          automagically sends all AFP traffic through it.</p><p>But it took until the release of Mac OS X 10.3 that this
          feature worked the first time... partly. In case, the SSH tunnel
          can't be established the AFP client <span class="strong"><strong>silently</strong></span> fell back to an unencrypted AFP
          connection attempt.</p><p>Netatalk's afpd will report that it is capable of handling SSH
          tunneled AFP requests, when both <code class="filename">-advertise_ssh</code>
          and <code class="filename">-fqdn</code> options are set in <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">afpd.conf</span>(5)</span> (double check with <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">asip-status</span>(1)</span> after you restarted afpd when you made changes to
          the settings). But there are a couple of reasons why you don't want
          to use this option at all:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Most users who need such a feature are probably already
              familiar with using a VPN; it might be easier for the user to
              employ the same VPN software in order to connect to the network
              on which the AFP server is running, and then to access the AFP
              server as normal.</p><p>That being said, for the simple case of connecting
              to one specific AFP server, a direct SSH connection is likely to
              perform better than a general-purpose VPN; contrary to popular
              belief, tunneling via SSH does <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span>
              result in what's called "TCP-over-TCP meltdown", because the
              AFP data that are being tunneled do not encapsulate TCP data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Since this SSH kludge isn't a normal UAM that integrates
              directly into the AFP authentication mechanisms but instead uses
              a single flag signalling clients whether they can <span class="strong"><strong>try</strong></span> to establish a tunnel or not, it
              makes life harder to see what's happening when things go
              wrong.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>You cannot control which machines are logged on by
              Netatalk tools like a <span class="command"><strong>macusers</strong></span> since all
              connection attempts seem to be made from localhost.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Indeed, to ensure that all AFP over TCP sessions are encrypted
              via SSH, you need to limit afpd to connections that originate
              only from localhost (e.g., by using Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers,
              or by using suitable firewall or packet-filtering facilities, etc.).</p><p>Otherwise, when you're using Mac OS X 10.2 through 10.3.3,
              you get the opposite of what you'd expect: potentially unencrypted AFP
              communications (including login credentials) being sent across the network
              without a single notification that establishing the tunnel
              failed. Apple fixed that not until Mac OS X 10.3.4.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Encrypting all AFP sessions via SSH can lead to a
              significantly higher load on the computer that is running
              the AFP server, because that computer must also handle
              encryption.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="acls"></a>ACL Support<a id="idm794" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>ACL support for AFP is implemented for ZFS ACLs on Solaris and

        Netatalk reads ACLs on the fly and calculates effective permissions
        which are then sent to the AFP client via the so called
        UARights<a id="idm800" class="indexterm"></a> permission bits. On a Mac, the Finder uses these bits
          to adjust permission in Finder windows. Example: a folder whose
          UNIX mode is read-only and an ACL giving the user write access,
          will display the effective read-write permission. Without the
          permission mapping the Finder would display a read-only icon and
          the user wouldn't be able to write to the folder.</p><p>However, neither in Finder "Get Info" windows nor in Terminal
        will you be able to see the ACLs, that's a result of how ACLs in OS X
        are designed. If you want to be able to display ACLs on the client,
        things get more involved as you must then setup both client and server
        to be part on a authentication domain (directory service, eg LDAP,
        OpenDirectory). The reason is, that in OS X ACLs are bound to UUIDs,
        not just uid's or gid's. Therefore, afpd must be able to map every
        filesystem uid and gid to a UUID so that it can return the server side
        ACLs which are bound to UNIX uid and gid mapped to OS X UUIDs.</p><p>In detail:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>For Solaris/ZFS: ZFS Volumes</p><p>You should configure a ZFS ACL know for any volume you want

      currently true (notably True64 Unix) so you can use only netatalk

      overlap each other. Fortunately netatalk's atalkd is polite enough to
      check whether your settings are in conflict with already existing ones
      on the net. In such a case it simply discards your settings and tries to
      adapt the already established ones on the net (if in doubt, always check
      syslog for details).</p><p>Netranges, you can use, include pretty small ones, eg. 42-42, to
      very large ones, eg. 1-65279 - the latter one representing the maximum.
      In routed environments you can use any numbers in the range between 1
      and 65279 unless they do not overlap with settings of other connected
      subnets.</p><p>The own AppleTalk address consists of a net part and a node part
      (the former 16 bit, the latter 8 bit, for example 12057.143). Apple
      recommends using node addresses of 128 or above for servers, letting
      client Macs assign themselves an address faster (as they will primarily
      search for a node address within 1-127 in the supplied netrange). As we
      don't want to get in conflict with Apple servers, we prefer using node
      addresses of 142 or above.</p><p>AppleTalk zones have <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> to do with
      physical networks. They're just a hint for your client's convenience,
      letting them locate network resources in a more comfortable/faster way.
      You can either use one zone name across multiple physical segments as
      well as more than one zone name on a single segment (and various
      combinations of this).</p><p>So all you have to do is to <span class="emphasis"><em>draw a network
      chart</em></span> containing the physical segments, the netranges you
      want to assign to each one, the zone names you want to publish in which
      segments and the default zone per segment (this is always the first zone
      name, you supply with the "-zone" switch in atalkd.conf).</p><p>Given, you finished the steps outlined above, you might want to
      edit atalkd.conf to fit your needs.</p><p>You'll have to set the following options in atalkd.conf:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>-net (use reasonable values between 1-65279 for each

          the node address should be between 142 and 255)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>-zone (can be used multiple times in one single line, the
          first entry is the default zone)</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that you are able to set up "zone mapping", that means
      publishing exactly the same zone name on all AppleTalk segments, as well
      as providing more than one single zone name per interface. Dumb
      AppleTalk devices, like LaserWriters, will always register themselves in
      the default zone (the first zone entry you use in atalkd.conf per
      interface), more intelligent ones will have the ability to choose one
      specific zone via a user interface.</p><div class="example"><a id="idm927"></a><p class="title"><strong>Example 3.5. atalkd.conf making netatalk a seed router on two

        The settings for eth0 force AppleTalk devices within the connected

        zone names are published into this segment, "Printers" being the so
        called "standard zone", forcing dumb AppleTalk devices like Laser
        printers to show up automatically into this zone. AppleTalk printer

        router from now on between the segments. So even in case, all of the
        three seed routers would disappear from the net, atalkd would still
        supply the connected network with the network configuration once
        learned from them. Only in case, atalkd would be restarted afterwards,

    specific startup script templates that are tailored according to the
    options given to the "configure" script before compiling. Currently,
    templates are provided for systemd (cross-platform), RedHat,
    SuSE, Gentoo, Debian, NetBSD, Solaris, and Tru64. You can select to
    install the generated startup script(s).
    <a id="idm1091" class="indexterm"></a> by specifying a system type to "configure". To
    automatically install startup scripts for e.g. the Ubuntu distribution
    try to give the <code class="option">--enable-debian</code> option to "configure". Some
    of the non-systemd scripts can be further parametrized by the configuration file
    netatalk.conf (described in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">netatalk.conf</span>(5)</span> manual page), some obtain that information in another,
    operating system specific way (like NetBSD, Debian and so on).</p><p>If you use the cross-platform <code class="option">--enable-systemd</code>
    option, there is no need to specify the system type. Also, the <code class="filename">
    netatalk.conf</code> configuration file is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
    used by systemd unit configurations.</p><p>Since new releases of Linux distributions appear all the time and
    the startup procedure for the other systems mentioned above might change
    as well, it is probably a good idea to not blindly install a startup
    script but to look at it first to see if it will work on your system. If
    you use Netatalk as part of a fixed setup, like a Linux distribution, an
    RPM or a BSD package, things will probably have been arranged properly for
    you. The following therefore applies mostly for people who have compiled
    Netatalk themselves.</p><p>The following daemons need to be started by whatever startup script
    mechanism is used:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>atalkd<a id="idm1107" class="indexterm"></a> (if you use the AppleTalk protocol)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>papd<a id="idm1111" class="indexterm"></a> (if you want to provide print services via
        AppleTalk)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>timelord<a id="idm1115" class="indexterm"></a> (for old style time synchronization via
        AppleTalk)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a2boot<a id="idm1119" class="indexterm"></a> (Apple II boot server via AppleTalk)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>cnid_metad<a id="idm1123" class="indexterm"></a> (if the dbd CNID backend is used)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>afpd<a id="idm1127" class="indexterm"></a></p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, make sure that the various configuration files
    (<code class="filename">afpd.conf</code>,
    <code class="filename">AppleVolumes.default</code>, <code class="filename">papd.conf</code>
    etc.) are in the right place and that
    <code class="filename">netatalk.conf</code><a id="idm1134" class="indexterm"></a> (if used) contains the right entries. If you want e.g. papd
    to be started using this mechanism, set the environment variable
    "<code class="option">PAPD_RUN</code>"<a id="idm1137" class="indexterm"></a> to "yes" in netatalk.conf. See the manual pages for
    details.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="installation.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="upgrade.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 2. Installation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 4. Upgrading from  Netatalk 1.x</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
