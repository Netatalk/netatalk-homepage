</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Changes in 1.5.3</h3>

<p>
UPD: Extend the --disable-shell-check functionality to ignore users

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in 1.5.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
NEW: NetBSD support contributed by David Rankin and NetBSD contributors.
       This includes a new configure option --enable-netbsd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NEW: Add the -client_polling afpd.conf flag to allow for clients to poll
       the server every 10 seconds for open window updates.  Currently
       this is the only way to get asynchronous directory updates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: Use separate macro for AFS configure check.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: Some Perl scripts are now (partially) auto-generated. This improves
       out-of-the-box usage of Netatalk.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: Solaris Kernel Makefile is now auto-generated. This fixes some path
       issues, but isn't perfect, yet. Added some Solaris compatibility
       fixes to the Kernel sources, too.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: CNID DB code sync'd with the current CVS version.  NOTE: Using this
       code requires you to delete _all_ existing .AppleDB directories in
       order to avoid database corruption!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: The file AppleVolumes.system contained wrong line breaks so that
       not all file types were properly recognized.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: AFS compilation would fail due to a misnamed variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Some problems with wrongly assigned DIDs were fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Various bug fixes and code cleanups.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in 1.5.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
NEW: Added a program called cnid_didname_verify that can be used to
       verify the consistency of the CNID database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NEW: New afpd option: -timeout. Warning: This still doesn't do what it's
       supposed to!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: Code cleanups and compatibility fixes to macusers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UPD: AppleVolumes.system was cleaned up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Really fix Tru64 compilation (see last entry).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Hand correct error value back to AFP client when deleting files or
       directories fails.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Leading or trailing spaces are now forbidden on volumes that have
       the AFPVOL_MSWINDOWS flag set.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Minor code cleanups and warning fixes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Make quota support work on FreeBSD.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in 1.5.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Compilation on Tru64 systems was broken, since libtool's acinclude.m4
       file on the packagers system did not contain the necessary patch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: On some systems, atalkd refuses to start, since it couldn't detect
       any interfaces. This was caused by an overzealous validity check.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in 1.5rc2</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
FIX: contrib/shell_utils/lp2pap.sh was erased when "make clean" was called.
       Now we distribute lp2pap.sh.tmpl instead, and lp2pap.sh is automatically
       generated during package build.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FIX: Some platforms (notably Tru64) don't have the snprintf() call, which
       was used in etc/afp/afp_config.c. This call was replaced by sprintf()
       and prior bounds checking.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.4b1 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Fixed the maximum free/total volume size in afpd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Made ~ the default volume in afpd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed pid file handling and changed setpgrp() to setpgid() in afpd,
    papd, and atalkd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added code to afpd to set the Unix file time stamps with utime().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in papd's printcap code which limited it to 15 or so
    printers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed papd's handling of piped printers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed papd's handling of bad job names.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed atalkd to send NBP LKUP packets from NBP port.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added "sync;sync;sync" to Solaris kinstall to help with streams
    file corruption.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added nlocalrts to streams ddp.conf.  Thanks Thomas Tornblom.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed signed extension infinite loop in Solaris module.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Moved all the config files to &hellip;/config.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.3.3 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Added code from Sun Microsystems, Inc (OPCOM) for Solaris support.
    See COPYRIGHT.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for FreeBSD, mostly changes by Mark Dawson and Julian
    Elischer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
All sorts of other stuff.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.3.1 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Added options to psf's filter names to support accounting on HPs.
    !!! NOTE:  The location of the filters has changed, see the man
    page for where.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added code from Alan Cox to support Linux.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rewrote papd.  Now handles dropped connections better.
    Configuration has been modernized.  !!! NOTE: The format of the
    configuration file has changed, but NOT THE NAME.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added Kerberos support to papd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atalkd now removes routes on a SIGTERM.  Still can't just restart
    it, but it's closer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changed atalkd and the kernel driver to remove a hack added to
    support sending to 0.255.  Now the kernel will allow multiple open
    sockets with the same port, so long as the addess associated with
    the port is different.  atalkd now opens a socket for each port on
    each interface.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atalkd now rewrites its configuration file.  If no configuration
    file is given, one will be generated.  Permissions on the new
    configuration file will be inherited from the old one.  If there is
    no old one, permissions default to 644.  Won't rewrite the file if
    the owner doesn't have write permission.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed support for the "AFS Kerberos UAM", in favor of the
    "AuthMan UAM".  Kerberos support should now be much more
    straight-forward.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause incorrect group calculations
    on ultrix machines.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in afpd which causes SimpleText and some other
    applications to silently fail to write.  There's also a bug in
    MacOS, but we can't fix that.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bad interaction with afpd and AFS which would cause file
    writes to not propogate between AFS clients.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
!!! CHANGED the name(s) of afpd's config files.  The new files are
    AppleVolumes.system and AppleVolumes.default.  If AppleVolumes.system
    exists, it is always read, AppleVolumes.default is only read if the
    user has no AppleVolumes file.  Included a flag "-u" to indicate
    which file has precedence.  "-u" user wins, otherwise ".system"
    wins.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rewrote the AppleVolumes parsing code.  Now works.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a filename extension mapping to afpd.  User always takes
    precedence, regardless of the "-u" flag.  Code to change the type
    of all Unix files contributed by Kee Hinckley &lt;nazgul@utopia.com&gt;.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
afpd now supports both UFS and AFS volumes simultaneously.  It also
    uses access() to attempt to calculate reasonable Mac permissions
    for AFS directories.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changed reporting of file times.  Files that are written from Unix
    now update the Mac's idea of the files modification time.  Unix
    mtime is now reported instead of ctime.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for a new UAM to afpd.  This requires that client
    Macs have MacTCP and AuthMan installed.  Should make running afpd
    for AFS easier.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed code so that otherwise valid volumes for which the mounting
    user has no permission will appear in the volume selection dialog
    on the Mac gray-ed out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added code from Chris Metcalf of MIT to the AppleDouble library
    which improves permission inheritance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added code from G. Paul Ziemba of Alantec, Inc to better report
    errors in psf.  Also changed psf to use syslog for errors that
    users aren't interested in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added information to psf's man page to better explain the
    interaction between psf, pap, and lpd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make psf/pap/psa do accounting when it's turnes on in
    /etc/printcap.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changed pap's error message when there is no printer specified on
    the command line and no .paprc is found.  Also heavily modified
    pap's man page to reflect changes in the "new" version of pap,
    including moving it from section 8 to section 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a byte-order bug in pap's sequence numbers.  Doubt if pap has
    ever worked right on little endian machines!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a flag to pap to optionally close before receiving EOF from
    the printer.  Off by default.  psf calls pap with this option on.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added timeouts to the nbp library calls.  This means that processes
    won't hang when atalkd dies during boot, thus hanging your
    machine.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.3 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause APPL mappings to contain both
    mac and unix path names.  The fixed code will handle the old
    (corrupted) database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a *very* serious bug which would cause files to be corrupted
    when copying to afpd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause replies to icon writes to
    contain the written icon.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Filled in the function code switch in afpd.  Previously, a hacker
    could probably have used afpd to get unauthorized access to a
    machine running afpd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in the asp portion of libatalk.a which could cause the
    malloc()/free() database to be corrupted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fixed a bug in atalkd's zip query code.  With this bug, only the
    first N % 255 nets get queried.  However, since nets bigger than
    255 are usually pretty unstable, the unqueried for nets will
    eventually get done, when N drops by one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Suppressed a spurious error ("route: No such process") in atalkd.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.2.1 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
atalkd is completely rewritten for phase 2 support.  atalkd.conf
    from previous version will not work!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
afpd now has better AFS support.  In particular, the configuration
    for AFS was made much easier; a number of Kerberos-related
    byte-ordering and time problems were found; clear-text passwords
    were added (thanks to geeb@umich.edu).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
afpd now handles Unix permissions much better (thanks to
    metcalf@mit.edu).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are many, many more changes, but most are small bug fixes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes from the 1.2 release:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The Sun support now uses loadable kernel modules (a la VDDRV)
    instead of binary patches. As such, it should work on any sunos
    greater than 4.1, and is confirmed to work under 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The DEC support no longer requires source. It also runs under
    ultrix 4.1 and 4.2. It still requires patching your kernel, but the
    patches are limited to those files available to binary-only sites
    &mdash; primarily hooks for things like netatalk.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The etc.rc script now uses changes made to nbprgstr (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
aecho now takes machine names on the command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
nbplkup now takes a command line argument specifying the number of
    responses to accept. It also takes its defaults from the NBPLKUP
    environment variable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
nbprgstr may be used to register a name at any requested port.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
afpd now logs if an illegal shell is used during login, instead of
    silently denying service.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A bug in afpd which caused position information for the directory
    children of the root of a volume to be ignored has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several typos in afpd which would cause include files necessary to
    ultrix to be skipped have been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atalkd will no long propagate routes to networks whose zone
    it doesn't know.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atalkd no longer dumps core if it receives a ZIP GetMyZone request
    from a network whose zone it doesn't know. (Since this currently
    can only happen from off net, it's not precisely a legal request.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
pap and papd (optionally) no longer check the connection id in PAP
    DATA responses. Both also maintain the function code in non-first-packet
    PAP DATA responses.  These changes are work-arounds to deal with
    certain AppleTalk printer cards, notably the BridgePort LocalTalk
    card for HP LJIIISIs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
pap no longer sends an EOF response to each PAP SENDDATA request,
    only the first.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A bug in papd which would cause it to return a random value when
    printing the procset to a piped printer has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A bug relating to NBP on reverse-endian machines has been fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atp_rsel() from libatalk now returns a correct value even if it
    hasn't recieved anything yet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
atalk_addr() from libatalk no longer accepts addresses in octal
    format, since AppleTalk addresses can have leading zeros. Also it
    checks that the separator character is a '.'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Pseudo man pages for nbplkup, nbprgstr, and nbpunrgstr, have been
    added.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The example in the psf(8) man page is now correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The man pages for changed commands have been updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The README files for various machine have been updated
    appropriately.
</p>
</li>
