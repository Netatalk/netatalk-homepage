<h1>Netatalk 2.3.0</h1><hr />
<h1>Netatalk 2.3.0</h1>
<p>Netatalk 2.3.0 is available!</p>
<p>The Netatalk development team is proud to announce a new feature release from the venerable Netatalk 2 branch, notable for maintaining support for AppleTalk clients.</p>
<p>This version contains stability and security improvements, while removing long-obsoleted or less used functionality. Early adopters are recommended to upgrade their deployments to version 2.3.0.</p>
<h2>New features</h2>
<p>The following compile time options have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--disable-install-privileged</code> (skips actions that require root access)</li>
<li><code>--with-systemd-prefix</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<p>As of Netatalk 2.3.0, the Database Daemon <code>dbd</code> CNID backend is the only one provided for use in production environments. The <code>last</code> CNID backend is still available for testing and read-only volumes.</p>
<p>The DHX UAM is now disabled by default, to avoid errors stemming from <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/22158">OpenSSL v3.0 removal of 128 bit modulus size support</a>. See https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues/358 for more details on how to make DHX work on your system, and on using alternative UAMs for authenticating with older clients.</p>
<p>The following features have been removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent Database (cdb) CNID backend</li>
<li>Trivial Database (tdb) CNID backend</li>
<li>Volume mount preexec and postexec commands</li>
<li>Dropbox / dropkludge</li>
<li>Force UID/GID</li>
<li>Andrew File System (AFS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compatibility macros for the following long-obsoleted operating systems have been removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>SunOS</li>
<li>IRIX</li>
<li>AIX</li>
<li>Ultrix</li>
<li>HPUX</li>
<li>Tru64,</li>
<li>GNU/kFreeBSD</li>
<li>UnixWare</li>
</ul>
<h3>afpd</h3>
<p>The following runtime options have been removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>nodebug (afpd.conf)</li>
<li>nostat</li>
<li>preexec</li>
<li>postexec</li>
<li>root_preexec</li>
<li>root_postexec</li>
<li>preexec_close</li>
<li>root_preexec_close</li>
<li>dropbox</li>
<li>dropkludge</li>
</ul>
<p>The following compile time options have been removed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--enable-debug</code></li>
<li><code>--enable-debug1</code></li>
<li><code>--enable-afs</code></li>
<li><code>--enable-force-uidgid</code></li>
<li><code>--enable-dropkludge</code></li>
<li><code>--with-cnid-tdb-backend</code></li>
<li><code>--with-cnid-cdb-backend</code></li>
<li><code>--with-webmin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Renamed:
* asip-status.pl has been renamed to asip-status</p>
<h3>atalkd</h3>
<p>Netatalk versions 2.2.7 through 2.2.10 had the non-standard behavior of <a href="https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues/585">not rebroadcasting routing information originating from other subnets</a>. This made certain Asant√© or Dayna LocalTalk hardware bridges able to coexist with netatalk, with the drawback that subnets behind other routers aren&rsquo;t visible to the netatalk clients.</p>
<p>Netatalk 2.3.0 restores the correct behavior as per the AppleTalk specification. If you want to emulate the previous non-standard behavior, you can start <code>atalkd</code> with the newly introduced <code>-q</code> parameter.</p>
