<p>Throughout the years the have been numerous reports of problems with Netatalk where the AFP read performance is very, very bad.</p>
<p><span id="more-90"></span></p>
<p>Our investigations have shown that this is caused by subtle TCP/IP stack incompatibilites: OS X clients from 10.4 upwards use a TCP feature called delayed ACKing, which in some cases causes the server TCP stack stop sending because it is (wrongly) assuming the client is not yet ready to receive data.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is an easy workaround: by adjusting a sysctl tunable you can configure the OS X TCP stack to ACK in a more traditional way. It is easy to try out if you&#8217;re affected by this problem: as a user with administrative rights run the following commands on one affected OS X client:</p>
<blockquote><p>$ sudo -s<br/>
Password: &#8230;enter password&#8230;<br/>
# sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=2<br/>
# exit</p></blockquote>
<p>Now check if the read performance goes up to a normal level. If it does: this way of adjusting the sysctl tunable does not survice a system reboot. In order to have it applied automatically upon system start use the following commands:</p>
<blockquote><p>$ sudo -s<br/>
Password: &#8230;enter password&#8230;<br/>
# echo &#8220;net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=2&#8221; &gt; /etc/sysctl.conf<br/>
# exit</p></blockquote>
<p>After rebooting you can check if the change got applied by:</p>
<blockquote><p>$ sysctl net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack<br/>
2</p></blockquote>
