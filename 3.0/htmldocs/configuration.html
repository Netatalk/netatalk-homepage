      use for file services. The protocol has evolved over the years. The
      latest changes to the protocol, called "AFP 3.3", were added with the
      release of Snow Leopard<a id="idp139639143835392" class="indexterm"></a> (Mac OS X 10.6).</p><p>The afpd daemon offers the fileservices to Apple clients. The only
      configuration file is <code class="filename">afp.conf</code>. It uses a ini style
      configuration syntax.</p><p>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) added support for Time Machine backups
      over AFP. Two new functions ensure that backups are written to spinning
      disk, not just in the server's cache. Different host operating systems
      honour this cache flushing differently. To make a volume a Time Machine
      target use the volume option "<code class="option">time machine =
      yes</code>".</p><p>Starting with Netatalk 2.1 UNIX symlinks<a id="idp139639143839824" class="indexterm"></a> can be used on the server. Semantics are the same as for
      eg NFS, ie they are not resolved on the server side but instead it's
      completely up to the client to resolve them, resulting in links that
      point somewhere inside the clients filesystem view.</p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639143841808"></a>afp.conf</h4></div></div></div><p><code class="filename">afp.conf</code> is the configuration file used by
        afpd to determine the behaviour and configuration of the AFP file
        serverand the AFP volume that it provides.</p><p>The <code class="filename">afp.conf</code> is divided into several
        sections:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">[Global]</span></dt><dd><p>The global section defines general server options</p></dd><dt><span class="term">[Homes]</span></dt><dd><p>The homes section defines user home volumes</p></dd></dl></div><p>Any section not called <code class="option">Global</code> or
        <code class="option">Homes</code> is interpreted as an AFP volume.</p><p>For sharing user homes by defining a <code class="option">Homes</code>
        section you must specify the option <code class="option">basedir regex</code>
        which can be a simple string with the path to the parent directory of
        all user homes or a regular expression.</p><p>Example:</p><pre class="programlisting">[Homes]
basedir regex = /home
</pre><p>Now any user logging into the AFP server will have a user volume
        available whos path is <code class="filename">/home/NAME</code>.</p><p>A more complex setup would be a server with a large amount of
        user homes which are split across eg two different
        filesystems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>/RAID1/homes</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>/RAID2/morehomes</p></li></ul></div><p>The following configuration is
        required:</p><pre class="programlisting">[Homes]
basedir regex = /RAID./.*homes
</pre><p>If <code class="option">basedir regex</code> contains symlink, set the
        canonicalized absolute path. When <code class="filename">/home</code> links to
        <code class="filename">/usr/home</code>: </p><pre class="programlisting">[Homes]
basedir regex = /usr/home</pre><p>For a more detailed explanation of the available options, please
        refer to the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">afp.conf</span>(5)</span> man page.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="CNID-backends"></a>CNID<a id="idp139639143862688" class="indexterm"></a> backends<a id="idp139639143864240" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>Unlike other protocols like SMB or NFS, the AFP protocol mostly
      refers to files and directories by ID and not by a path (the IDs are
      also called CNID, that means Catalog Node ID). A typical AFP request
      uses a directory ID<a id="idp139639143866336" class="indexterm"></a> and a filename, something like <span class="phrase">"server, please
      open the file named 'Test' in the directory with id 167"</span>. For
      example "Aliases" on the Mac basically work by ID (with a fallback to
      the absolute path in more recent AFP clients. But this applies only to
      Finder, not to applications).</p><p>Every file in an AFP volume has to have a unique file ID<a id="idp139639143869072" class="indexterm"></a>, IDs must, according to the specs, never be reused, and
      IDs are 32 bit numbers (Directory IDs use the same ID pool). So, after
      ~4 billion files/folders have been written to an AFP volume, the ID pool
      is depleted and no new file can be written to the volume. No whining
      please :-)</p><p>Netatalk needs to map IDs to files and folders in the host
      filesystem. To achieve this, several different CNID backends<a id="idp139639143871536" class="indexterm"></a> are available and can be choosed by the <code class="option">cnid
      scheme</code><a id="idp139639143872944" class="indexterm"></a> option in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">afp.conf</span>(5)</span> configuration file. A CNID backend is basically a
      database storing ID &lt;-&gt; name mappings.</p><p>The CNID Databases are by default located in
      <code class="filename">/var/netatalk/CNID</code>.</p><p>There is a command line utility called <span class="command"><strong>dbd</strong></span>
      available which can be used to verify, repair and rebuild the CNID
      database.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>There are some CNID related things you should keep in mind when
        working with netatalk:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Don't nest volumes<a id="idp139639143884272" class="indexterm"></a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>CNID backends are databases, so they turn afpd into a file

            using the <code class="option">vol dbpath</code> option and put the database
            files into another location or, if you use quotas, make sure the
            CNID database folder is owned by a user/group without a

            i.e. database corruption. Use the <code class="option">vol dbpath</code>
            directive to put the databases onto a local disk if you must use

With
        this backend, several afpd daemons access the CNID database directly.
        Berkeley DB locking is used to synchronize access, if more than one
        afpd process is active for a volume. The drawback is, that the crash
        of a single afpd process might corrupt the database. cdb should only
        be used when sharing home directories for a larger number of users
        <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> it has been determined that a large number of

        process. afpd processes communicate with the daemon for database reads
        and updates. The probability for database corruption is practically
        zero.</p><p>This is the default backend since Netatalk 2.1.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639143901168"></a>tdb<a id="idp139639143901744" class="indexterm"></a></h4></div></div></div><p><abbr class="abbrev">tdb</abbr> is another persistent CNID database, it's

        database) as a fallback in case opening the primary database can't be
        opened, because <abbr class="abbrev">tdb</abbr> can work as in-memory database.

        texts, they only know numbers. Therefore, each letter is assigned a
        number. A character set, often referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>charset</em></span> or
        <span class="emphasis"><em>codepage</em></span><a id="idp139639143916208" class="indexterm"></a>, defines the mappings between numbers and
        letters.</p><p>If two or more computer systems need to communicate with each
        other, the have to use the same character set. In the 1960s the
        ASCII<a id="idp139639143918016" class="indexterm"></a> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
        character set was defined by the American Standards Association. The
        original form of ASCII represented 128 characters, more than enough to
        cover the English alphabet and numerals. Up to date, ASCII has been
        the normative character scheme used by computers.</p><p>Later versions defined 256 characters to produce a more
        international fluency and to include some slightly esoteric graphical
        characters. Using this mode of encoding each character takes exactly
        one byte. Obviously, 256 characters still wasn't enough to map all the
        characters used in the various languages into one character
        set.</p><p>As a result localized character sets were defined later, e.g the
        ISO-8859 character sets. Most operating system vendors introduced
        their own characters sets to satisfy their needs, e.g. IBM defined the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>codepage 437 (DOSLatinUS)</em></span>, Apple introduced the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>MacRoman</em></span><a id="idp139639143922176" class="indexterm"></a> codepage and so on. The characters that were assigned
        number larger than 127 were referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>extended</em></span> characters. These character sets
        conflict with another, as they use the same number for different
        characters, or vice versa.</p><p>Almost all of those characters sets defined 256 characters,
        where the first 128 (0-127) character mappings are identical to ASCII.
        As a result, communication between systems using different codepages
        was effectively limited to the ASCII charset.</p><p>To solve this problem new, larger character sets were defined.
        To make room for more character mappings, these character sets use at
        least 2 bytes to store a character. They are therefore referred to as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>multibyte</em></span> character sets.</p><p>One standardized multibyte charset encoding scheme is known as
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.unicode.org/" target="_top">unicode</a>. A big advantage
        of using a multibyte charset is that you only need one. There is no
        need to make sure two computers use the same charset when they are
        communicating.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639143928016"></a>character sets used by Apple</h4></div></div></div><p>In the past, Apple clients used single-byte charsets to
        communicate over the network. Over the years Apple defined a number of
        codepages, western users will most likely be using the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>MacRoman</em></span> codepage.</p><p>Codepages defined by Apple include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>MacArabic, MacFarsi</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCentralEurope</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacChineseSimple</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacChineseTraditional</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCroation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacCyrillic</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacDevanagari</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacGreek</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacHebrew</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacIcelandic</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacJapanese</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacKorean</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacRoman</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacRomanian</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacThai</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>MacTurkish</p></li></ul></div><p>Starting with Mac OS X and AFP3, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.utf-8.com/" target="_top">UTF-8</a> is used. UTF-8 encodes
        Unicode characters in an ASCII compatible way, each Unicode character
        is encoded into 1-6 ASCII characters. UTF-8 is therefore not really a
        charset itself, it's an encoding of the Unicode charset.</p><p>To complicate things, Unicode defines several <span class="emphasis"><em> <a class="ulink" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/index.html" target="_top">normalization</a>
        </em></span> forms. While <a class="ulink" href="http://www.samba.org" target="_top">samba</a><a id="idp139639143947856" class="indexterm"></a> uses <span class="emphasis"><em>precomposed</em></span><a id="idp139639143949344" class="indexterm"></a> Unicode, which most Unix tools prefer as well, Apple
        decided to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>decomposed</em></span><a id="idp139639143951296" class="indexterm"></a> normalization.</p><p>For example lets take the German character
        '<span class="keycode">ä</span>'. Using the precomposed normalization, Unicode
        maps this character to 0xE4. In decomposed normalization, 'ä' is
        actually mapped to two characters, 0x61 and 0x308. 0x61 is the mapping
        for an 'a', 0x308 is the mapping for a <span class="emphasis"><em>COMBINING
        DIAERESIS</em></span>.</p><p>Netatalk refers to precomposed UTF-8 as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>UTF8</em></span><a id="idp139639143955392" class="indexterm"></a> and to decomposed UTF-8 as
        <span class="emphasis"><em>UTF8-MAC</em></span><a id="idp139639143957232" class="indexterm"></a>.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639143959072"></a>afpd and character sets</h4></div></div></div><p>To support new AFP 3.x and older AFP 2.x clients at the same

        authentication and UAMs in general. But since Apple introduced an
        option called "Allow Secure Connections Using SSH" and many people
        tend to confuse both things, we'll speak about that here too.</p><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="manualsshtunnel"></a>Manually tunneling an AFP session</h5></div></div></div><p>This works since the first AFP servers that spoke "AFP over
          TCP" appeared in networks. One simply tunnels the remote server's
          AFP port to a local port different than 548 and connects locally to
          this port afterwards. On OS X this can be done by</p><pre class="programlisting">ssh -l $USER $SERVER -L 10548:127.0.0.1:548 sleep 3000</pre><p>After establishing the tunnel one will use
          <code class="filename">"afp://127.0.0.1:10548"</code> in the "Connect to
          server" dialog. All AFP traffic including the initial connection
          attempts will be sent encrypted over the wire since the local AFP
          client will connect to the Mac's local port 10548 which will be
          forwarded to the remote server's AFP port (we used the default 548)
          over SSH.</p><p>These sorts of tunnels are an ideal solution if you've to
          access an AFP server providing weak authentications mechanisms
          through the Internet without having the ability to use a "real" VPN.
          Note that you can let <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> compress the data by
          using its "-C" switch and that the tunnel endpoints can be different
          from both AFP client and server (compare with the SSH documentation

          Connections Using SSH" checkbox to the "Connect to Server" dialog.
          The idea behind: When the server signals that it can be contacted by
          SSH then Mac OS X' AFP client tries to establish the tunnel and
          automagically sends all AFP traffic through it.</p><p>But it took until the release of Mac OS X 10.3 that this
          feature worked the first time... partly. In case, the SSH tunnel
          can't be established the AFP client <span class="strong"><strong>silently</strong></span> fell back to an unencrypted AFP

        Netatalk reads ACLs on the fly and calculates effective permissions
        which are then send to the AFP client via the so called
        UARights<a id="idp139639144183792" class="indexterm"></a> permission bits. On a Mac, the Finder uses these bits
        to adjust permission in Finder windows. For example folder whos UNIX
        mode would only result in in read-only permissions for a user will not
        be displayed with a read-only icon and the user will be able to write
        to the folder given the folder has an ACL giving the user write

        will you be able to see the ACLs, that's a result of how ACLs in OS X
        are designed. If you want to be able to display ACLs on the client,
        things get more involved as you must then setup both client and server
        to be part on a authentication domain (directory service, eg LDAP,
        OpenDirectory). The reason is, that in OS X ACLs are bound to UUIDs,
        not just uid's or gid's. Therefor afpd must be able to map every

        extension of the traditional UNIX permissions model. An ACL is an
        ordered list of Access Control Entries (ACEs) explicitly granting or
        denying a set of permissions to a given user or group.</p><p>Unlike UNIX permissions, which are bound to user or group IDs,
        ACLs are tied to UUIDs. For this reason accessing an object's ACL
        requires server and client to use a common directory service which
        translates between UUIDs and user/group IDs.</p><p>ACLs and UNIX permissions interact in a rather simple way. As
        ACLs are optional UNIX permissions act as a default mechanism for
        access control. Changing an objects's UNIX permissions will leave it's
        ACL intact and modifying an ACL will never change the object's UNIX
        permissions. While doing access checks, OS X first examines an
        object's ACL evaluating ACEs in order until all requested rights have
        been granted, a requested right has been explicitly denied by an ACE
        or the end of the list has been reached. In case there is no ACL or
        the permissions granted by the ACL are not sufficient to fulfill the
        request, OS X next evaluates the object's UNIX permissions. Therefore
        ACLs always have precedence over UNIX permissions.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639144205088"></a>ZFS ACLs</h4></div></div></div><p>ZFS ACLs closely match OS X ACLs. Both offer mostly identical
        fine grained permissions and inheritance settings.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp139639144206528"></a>POSIX ACLs</h4></div></div></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="idp139639144207248"></a>Overview</h5></div></div></div><p>Compared to OS X or NFSv4 ACLs, Posix ACLs represent a
          different, less versatile approach to overcome the limitations of
          the traditional UNIX permissions. Implementations are based on the
          withdrawn Posix 1003.1e standard.</p><p>The standard defines two types of ACLs. Files and directories
          can have access ACLs which are consulted for access checks.
          Directories can also have default ACLs irrelevant to access checks.
          When a new object is created inside a directory with a default ACL,
          the default ACL is applied to the new object as it's access ACL.
          Subdirectories inherit default ACLs from their parent. There are no
          further mechanisms of inheritance control. </p><p>Architectural differences between Posix ACLs and OS X ACLs
          especially involve:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>No fine-granular permissions model. Like UNIX
                permissions Posix ACLs only differentiate between read, write
                and execute permissions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Entries within an ACL are unordered.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Posix ACLs can only grant rights. There is no way to
                explicitly deny rights by an entry.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>UNIX permissions are integrated into an ACL as special
                entries.</p></li></ul></div><p>Posix 1003.1e defines 6 different types of ACL entries. The
          first three types are used to integrate standard UNIX permissions.
          They form a minimal ACL, their presence is mandatory and only one
          entry of each type is allowed within an ACL.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_USER_OBJ: the owner's access rights.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_GROUP_OBJ: the owning group's access rights.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_OTHER: everybody's access rights.</p></li></ul></div><p>The remaining entry types expand the traditional permissions
          model:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_USER: grants access rights to a certain user.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_GROUP: grants access rights to a certain
                group.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>ACL_MASK: limits the maximum access rights which can be
                granted by entries of type ACL_GROUP_OBJ, ACL_USER and
                ACL_GROUP. As the name suggests, this entry acts as a mask.
                Only one ACL_MASK entry is allowed per ACL. If an ACL contains
                ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP entries, an ACL_MASK entry must be
                present too, otherwise it is optional.</p></li></ul></div><p>In order to maintain compatibility with applications not aware
          of ACLs, Posix 1003.1e changes the semantics of system calls and
          utilities which retrieve or manipulate an objects UNIX permissions.
          In case an object only has a minimal ACL, the group permissions bits
          of the UNIX permissions correspond to the value of the ACL_GROUP_OBJ
          entry.</p><p>However, if the ACL also contains an ACL_MASK entry, the
          behavior of those system calls and utilities is different. The group
          permissions bits of the UNIX permissions correspond to the value of
          the ACL_MASK entry, i. e. calling "chmod g-w" will not only revoke
          write access for the group, but for all entities which have been
          granted write access by ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP entries.</p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="idp139639144224592"></a>Mapping POSIX ACLs to OS X ACLs</h5></div></div></div><p>When a client wants to read an object's ACL, afpd maps it's
          Posix ACL onto an equivalent OS X ACL. Writing an object's ACL
          requires afpd to map an OS X ACL onto a Posix ACL. Due to
          architectural restrictions of Posix ACLs, it is usually impossible
          to find an exact mapping so that the result of the mapping process
          will be an approximation of the original ACL's semantic.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>afpd silently discard entries which deny a set of
                permissions because they they can't be represented within the
                Posix architecture. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As entries within Posix ACLs are unordered, it is
                impossible to preserve order.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Inheritance control is subject to severe limitations as
                well:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>Entries with the only_inherit flag set will only

                      file_inherit, directory_inherit or limit_inherit set,
                      will become part of the directory's access and default
                      ACL, but the restrictions they impose on inheritance
                      will be ignored.</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>The lack of a fine-granular permission model on the
                Posix side will normally result in an increase of granted
                permissions.</p></li></ul></div><p>As OS X clients aren't aware of the Posix 1003.1e specific
          relationship between UNIX permissions and ACL_MASK, afpd does not
          expose this feature to the client to avoid compatibility issues and
          handles *unix permissions and ACLs the same way as Apple's reference
          implementation of AFP does. When an object's UNIX permissions are
          requested, afpd calculates proper group rights and returns the
          result together with the owner's and everybody's access rights to
          the caller via "permissions" and "ua_permissions" members of the
          FPUnixPrivs structure (see Apple Filing Protocol Reference, page
          181). Changing an object's permissions, afpd always updates
          ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ and ACL_OTHERS. If an ACL_MASK entry is
          present too, afpd recalculates it's value so that the new group
          rights become effective and existing entries of type ACL_USER or
          ACL_GROUP stay intact.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="fce"></a>Filesystem Change Events<a id="idp139639144236064" class="indexterm"></a></h3></div></div></div><p>Netatalk includes a nifty filesystem change event mechanism where

    specific startup script templates that are tailored according to the
    options given to the "configure" script before compiling. Currently,
    templates are provided for RedHat (sysv style), RedHat (systemd style),
    SUSE (sysv style), SUSE (systemd style), Gentoo, NetBSD, Debian and
    Solaris. You can select to install the generated startup script(s)
    <a id="idp139639144247616" class="indexterm"></a> by specifying a system type to "configure". To
    automatically install startup scripts give one of the available

    the startup procedure for the other systems mentioned above might change
    as well, it is probably a good idea to not blindly install a startup
    script but to look at it first to see if it will work on your system. If
    you use Netatalk as part of a fixed setup, like a Linux distribution, an
    RPM or a BSD package, things will probably have been arranged properly for
