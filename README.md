The first layer of index pages are generated from fragments of static html.

Release notes as well as wiki documentation pages are static html generated from markdown sources hosted on GitHub. See the Python scripts in the wiki/ dir.

Manual pages are static html generated with xsltproc from [XSL sources](https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/tree/main/doc).

# New release procedure

- Add the new release to `download.html.in` and `documentation.html.in` sources.
- Add the new netatalk release version to the "versions" list in `scripts/generate_releasenotes.py`
- Run the `run.sh` script, passing a GITHUB_TOKEN env variable with a valid GitHub API token.
- Validate the correctness and absence of spam in generated html sources in `public/`.
- Copy the html manual sources generated by docbook from `doc/manual/*.html` in the main netatalk repository to `public/x.y/htmldocs/`
