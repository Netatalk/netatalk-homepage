  <h1>Welcome to the Netatalk Homepage!</h1>

  <p>Netatalk is a Free and Open Source implementation of the
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">Apple Filing Protocol</a> (AFP).
     A macOS, Linux, BSD, or Solaris system running Netatalk can act as an AppleShare file server,
     sharing files to multiple macOS, Classic Mac OS, and Apple II clients simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Since 1990, Netatalk has been providing highly performant and versatile file sharing for Macs from
     UNIX-like hosts, providing seamless support for the unique requirements
     of Macintosh networking, file systems, and operating system services.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>So you want to get started with running your own Netatalk file server
  for your local network of Macs and Apple IIs? Well, you have come to the right place!</p>

  <p>For starters, the official (or an unofficial) package manager for your operating system
  may be distributing a ready-made binary <b>netatalk</b> package.
  Use the package manager's search functionality to find out.</p>

  <p>If you prefer a containerized installation, the Netatalk team distributes
  official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/netatalk">Docker images
  on Docker Hub</a>. These require Docker Engine to be installed.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you need to build Netatalk from the source code,
  a C compiler (gcc or clang) and dependent libraries are required.
  Read more in the <a href="stable/htmldocs">Netatalk manual</a>
  or the OS specific guides in the <a href="docs">wiki</a>.</p>

  <p>Once Netatalk is up and running, test that the AFP server responds on port 548 by running
  <tt>asip-status [server address]</tt>.
  If you get an "AFP reply" response, the Netatalk server is functioning properly!</p>

  <p>You will likely need to adjust the configurations to suit your setup.
  Netatalk has a dizzying amount of options which can be daunting initially.
  The Configuration chapter in the Netatalk manual is a good place to start.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
