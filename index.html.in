  <h1>Welcome to the Netatalk Homepage!</h1>

  <p>Netatalk is a Free and Open Source implementation of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">Apple Filing Protocol</a> (AFP).
  A macOS, Linux, BSD, or Solaris system running Netatalk can act as an AppleShare file server,
  providing file sharing services to multiple macOS, Classic Mac OS,
  and Apple II clients simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Since 1990, Netatalk has been providing highly performant and versatile file sharing for Macs from
  UNIX-like hosts, providing seamless support for the intricate requirements
  of Macintosh networking, file systems, and operating system services.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>So you want to get started with running your own Netatalk file server
  for your local network of Macs and Apple IIs? Well, you have come to the right place!
  For starters, the official (or an unofficial) package manager for your operating system
  may be distributing a ready-made binary <b>netatalk</b> package that you can install right away.</p>

  <p>If you prefer a containerized installation, the Netatalk team distributes
  official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/netatalk">Docker images
  on Docker Hub</a>. These require Docker Engine to be installed.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you need to build Netatalk from the source code,
  a C compiler (gcc or clang) and dependent libraries are required.
  Read more in the <a href="stable/htmldocs">Netatalk manual</a>
  or the OS specific guides in the <a href="docs">wiki</a>.</p>

  <p>Once Netatalk is up and running, test that the AFP server responds on port 548 by running
  <tt>asip-status [server address]</tt>.
  If you get an "AFP reply" response, the Netatalk server is functioning properly!
  You will likely need to adjust the configurations to suit your setup.
  Netatalk has a dizzying amount of options which can be daunting initially.
  The <a href="stable/htmldocs/configuration">Configuration chapter</a>
  in the Netatalk manual is a good place to start.</p>
