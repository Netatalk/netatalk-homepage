  <h1>Welcome to the Netatalk Homepage!</h1>

  <p>Netatalk is a Free and Open Source file server for Macs.
  Written in pure C, it is light-weight, performant, and portable.
  Conformant to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">
  Apple Filing Protocol</a> (AFP) specifiction up to and including AFP 3.4,
  any macOS, Mac OS X, or Mac OS system can talk to a Netatalk file server natively.
  </p>

  <p>Since 1990, Netatalk has been leveraged by universities, enterprises,
  and home users for collaboration and data backup on Macs.
  It enables any UNIX-like host to integrate seamlessly with
  macOS networking, file systems, and operating system services.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>So you want to get started with running your own Netatalk file server
  for your local network of Macs and Apple IIs? Well, you have come to the right place!
  For starters, many open source distributions and package repositories include Netatalk.
  Try searching for a <tt>netatalk</tt> package in your favorite package manager.</p>

  <p>If you prefer a containerized deployment, the Netatalk team distributes
  official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/netatalk">Docker images
  on Docker Hub</a>. These require Docker Engine to be installed.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you want to build Netatalk from source,
  a C compiler (gcc or clang are recommended) together with dependent libraries are required.
  Read more in the <a href="stable/htmldocs/installation">Netatalk manual</a>
  or the OS specific guides in the <a href="docs">wiki</a>.</p>

  <p>You will likely need to adjust the Netatalk configuration to suit your setup.
  Netatalk has a dizzying amount of options which can be daunting initially.
  The <a href="stable/htmldocs/configuration">Configuration</a> chapter
  and <a href="https://netatalk.io/stable/htmldocs/afp.conf.5">afp.conf</a> page
  in the Netatalk manual are good places to start.</p>
