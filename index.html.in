  <h1>Welcome to the Netatalk Homepage!</h1>

  <p>Netatalk is a Free and Open Source file server that implements the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol">Apple Filing Protocol</a> (AFP).
  A macOS, Linux, BSD, or Solaris system running Netatalk can act as an AppleShare server,
  providing file sharing services to any number of macOS, Classic Mac OS,
  and Apple II clients simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Since 1990, Netatalk has been providing highly performant and versatile file sharing for Macs from
  UNIX-like hosts, providing seamless support for the intricate requirements
  of Macintosh networking, file systems, and operating system services.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>So you want to get started with running your own Netatalk file server
  for your local network of Macs and Apple IIs? Well, you have come to the right place!
  For starters, many open source distributions and package repositories include Netatalk.
  Try searching for a <tt>netatalk</tt> package in your favorite package manager.</p>

  <p>If you prefer a containerized deployment, the Netatalk team distributes
  official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/netatalk">Docker images
  on Docker Hub</a>. These require Docker Engine to be installed.</p>

  <p>Finally, if you want to build Netatalk from source,
  a C compiler (gcc or clang are recommended) together with dependent libraries are required.
  Read more in the <a href="stable/htmldocs/installation">Netatalk manual</a>
  or the OS specific guides in the <a href="docs">wiki</a>.</p>

  <p>You will likely need to adjust the Netatalk configuration to suit your setup.
  Netatalk has a dizzying amount of options which can be daunting initially.
  The <a href="stable/htmldocs/configuration">Configuration</a> chapter
  and <a href="https://netatalk.io/stable/htmldocs/afp.conf.5">afp.conf</a> page
  in the Netatalk manual are good places to start.</p>
