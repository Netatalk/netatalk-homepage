# GUI Tool for packet capturing

You can use a nice program called
<a href="https://www.tastycocoabytes.com/"
target="_blank">CocoaPacketAnalyzer</a> in order to capture AFP network
traffic.

1.  Download and extract the program from above link.
2.  Start it.
3.  Press “Capturing”:

>     [<img src="/gfx/pic1-300x194.png" title="pic1"
    class="size-medium wp-image-948 alignnone" width="300" height="194" />

>     ](/gfx/pic1.png)
4.  In the dialog window that opens choose the active network interface,
    the first time you may be asked to scan for interfaces:

>     [<img src="/gfx/pic21-300x174.png" title="pic2"
    class="size-medium wp-image-954 alignnone" width="300" height="174" />](/gfx/pic21.png)
5.  Enter “port 548″ as filter expression:

>     [<img src="/gfx/pic31-300x174.png" title="pic3"
    class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-956" width="300" height="174" />](/gfx/pic31.png)
6.  Then when you’re ready to do the actual trace press “start”. When
    you’re done with the trace press “stop”. While tracing minimize
    activities on the AFP volume to, only perform actions that are
    required.
7.  Finally choose “Save” from the “File” menu to save the trace to a
    file.

# Using tcpdump with a ringbuffer

Another useful thing only available in Terminal with tcpdump is using a
ringbuffer:

    # tcpdump -s 0 -w afp.pcap -C 10 -W 2 port 548

This limits the captured data to two capture files (-W 2) with a size of
10 MB each (-C 10). This way for large amount of AFP traffic, only the
last 10-20 MB will be saved and available for analysis.
