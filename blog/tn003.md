Throughout the years the have been numerous reports of problems with
Netatalk where the AFP read performance is very, very bad.

Our investigations have shown that this is caused by subtle TCP/IP stack
incompatibilites: OS X clients from 10.4 upwards use a TCP feature
called delayed ACKing, which in some cases causes the server TCP stack
stop sending because it is (wrongly) assuming the client is not yet
ready to receive data.

Fortunately there is an easy workaround: by adjusting a sysctl tunable
you can configure the OS X TCP stack to ACK in a more traditional way.
It is easy to try out if you’re affected by this problem: as a user with
administrative rights run the following commands on one affected OS X
client:

```
$ sudo -s
Password: …enter password…
# sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=2
# exit
```

Now check if the read performance goes up to a normal level. If it does:
this way of adjusting the sysctl tunable does not survice a system
reboot. In order to have it applied automatically upon system start use
the following commands:

```
$ sudo -s
Password: …enter password…
# echo “net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=2” > /etc/sysctl.conf
# exit
```

After rebooting you can check if the change got applied by:

```
$ sysctl net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack
2
```
