# GUI Tool for packet capturing

You can use a nice program called
[CocoaPacketAnalyzer](https://www.tastycocoabytes.com/)
in order to capture AFP network traffic.

| Step | Instruction | Image |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1    | Download and extract the program from the above link. |       |
| 2    | Start it. |       |
| 3    | Press “Capturing”. | <img src="/gfx/pic1.png" title="pic1" class="size-medium wp-image-948 alignnone" width="300" height="194"> |
| 4    | In the dialog window that opens, choose the active network interface. The first time, you may be asked to scan for interfaces. | <img src="/gfx/pic21.png" title="pic2" class="size-medium wp-image-954 alignnone" width="300" height="174"> |
| 5    | Enter “port 548” as the filter expression. | <img src="/gfx/pic31.png" title="pic3" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-956" width="300" height="174"> |
| 6    | When ready to do the actual trace, press “start.” When done with the trace, press “stop.” Minimize activities on the AFP volume and perform only necessary actions. |       |
| 7    | Finally, choose “Save” from the “File” menu to save the trace to a file. |       |

# Using tcpdump with a ringbuffer

Another useful thing only available in Terminal with tcpdump is using a
ringbuffer:

```
# tcpdump -s 0 -w afp.pcap -C 10 -W 2 port 548
```

This limits the captured data to two capture files (-W 2) with a size of
10 MB each (-C 10). This way for large amount of AFP traffic, only the
last 10-20 MB will be saved and available for analysis.
