In case you ever wonder what these messages in *system.log* mean:

```
Apr 2 13:12:34 mac com.apple.backupd\[20052\]: Warning: Destination
/Volumes/Machine does not support Server Reply Cache

Apr 2 13:12:34 mac com.apple.backupd\[20052\]: Warning: Destination
/Volumes/Machine does not support TM Lock Stealing
```

The OS X client correctly reports here that the Netatalk AFP server is
missing two AFP features:

1.  “**Server Reply Cache**”

>   This is a new AFP 3.3 feature
    advertised to enhance reliability of AFP connections in case of
    intermittent connection drops. Netatalk has not yet implemented this
    feature and it’s not part of the current development
    roadmap.

>   Summary: don’t disrupt your
    network connection while backing up with TM!

2.  “**TM Lock Stealing**“

Another AFP 3.3 feature important in dealing with connection drops. This
one though is less important for Netatalk then it is for
AppleFileServer, because Netatalk uses a process per AFP connection,
while AppleFileServer uses a threaing model. In case the server Netatalk
afpd process of a specific connection crashes, it’s locks are gone
anyway.

Anyway, since Netatalk 2.0.5 there’s the option **options:tm** which you
can specify in AppleVolumes.default which will make Netatalk tell the
client it supports lock stealing, which in fact it does as described.

*Update (Feb-17-2011):*

Netatalk 2.2 (to be released soon) will support the AFP “**Server Reply
Cache”**. How nice!
