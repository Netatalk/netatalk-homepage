<div class="entry_content"><p>In case you ever wonder what these messages in <em>system.log</em> mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apr 2 13:12:34 mac com.apple.backupd[20052]: Warning: Destination /Volumes/Machine does not support Server Reply Cache</p>
<p>Apr 2 13:12:34 mac com.apple.backupd[20052]: Warning: Destination /Volumes/Machine does not support TM Lock Stealing</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p>The OS X client correctly reports here that the Netatalk AFP server is missing two AFP features:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>&#8220;</em><strong>Server Reply Cache&#8221;<br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This is a new AFP 3.3 feature advertised to enhance reliability of AFP connections in case of intermittent connection drops. Netatalk has not yet implemented this feature and it&#8217;s not part of the current development roadmap.</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-style: normal;">Summary: don&#8217;t disrupt your network connection while backing up with TM!</span></em></p>
<p><em> </em></li>
<li>&#8220;<strong>TM Lock Stealing</strong>&#8220;</li>
</ol>
<ol>Another AFP 3.3 feature important in dealing with connection drops. This one though is less important for Netatalk then it is for AppleFileServer, because Netatalk uses a process per AFP connection, while AppleFileServer uses a threaing model. In case the server Netatalk afpd process of a specific connection crashes, it&#8217;s locks are gone anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Netatalk 2.0.5 there&#8217;s the option <strong>options:tm</strong> which you can specify in AppleVolumes.default which will make Netatalk tell the client it supports lock stealing, which in fact it does as described.<em> </em></ol>
<div><em>Update (Feb-17-2011):</em></div>
<div>Netatalk 2.2 (to be released soon) will support the AFP &#8220;<strong>Server Reply Cache&#8221;</strong>. How nice!</div>
