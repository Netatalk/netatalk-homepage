## The state of Apple’s Time Machine in Lion

**Affected Operating Systems:**

- Mac OS X Lion 10.7.0
- Mac OS X Lion 10.7.1

**Time Machine Symptoms:**

- TM reports backup verification failed and wants to restart from
  scratch
- TM restore not working
- TM process “Prepare Backup” takes longer than expected
- TM reports incorrectly the amount of time left to backup
- TM completes uploading backup but “Finishing Backup” takes longer than
  expected or does not complete until manually “Stopping Backup”

After analysis and research we understand that these issues are
unrelated to the Netatalk AFP services. Reading Apple Time Capsule
customer feedback in the Apple Communities support forums it is apparent
that the same problems exist there too.
