The recent release of OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) for the Mac has
introduced a permission problem when copying certain files that e.g.
have been downloaded from the Internet.

<span id="more-3">*The OS X Client added extended attributes to
the files, most notably files ending in .dmg, to flag the file as
potentially malicious and send an alert when the file is opened. This
extended attribute will cause a permission problem when copying the file
to the Netatalk server, and you will see this error:

If you’re using a Netatalk version \>= 2.0.4 you can use the following
workaround of adding *fperm=0600* to the volume configuration file for
every volume or by adding it to the *DEFAULT* config line, e.g.:

```
:DEFAULT: fperm:0600
```
