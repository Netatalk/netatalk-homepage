This directory contains the Netatalk logo in various formats.

First published on January 4th 2005 on http://netatalk.sourceforge.net
on the cover page for the Netatalk manual PDF by Thomas Kaiser.
The manual is distributed under the GNU GPL 2.0,
so the logo image is assumed to be distributed under the same license.
The canonical png bitmap image was subsequently extracted from said PDF.
